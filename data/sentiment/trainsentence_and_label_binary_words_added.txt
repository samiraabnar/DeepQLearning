0 The effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it 's hardly watchable .
1 Analyze That regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in .
0 With flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , Undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout ... by which time it 's impossible to care who wins .
0 Stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom .
0 To the civilized mind , a movie like Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement .
0 Equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old 's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1982 and Farenheit 450 .
0 The lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced ... It 's a pity that -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- achievement does n't match his ambition .
1 When Seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , I wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , ` Hey , Kool-Aid ! '
1 An easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character .
0 Imagine the CleanFlicks version of ` Love Story , ' with Ali MacGraw 's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes .
0 PC stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion .
0 Forget the misleading title , what 's with the unexplained baboon cameo ?
0 An odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy .
0 Though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere .
0 Pascale Bailly 's rom-com provides Amélie 's Audrey Tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i.e. , a banal spiritual quest .
1 A static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes .
2 Watching the chemistry between Freeman and Judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing .
1 Almost .
0 ... a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman .
1 The Country Bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers .
0 Unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either .
0 The cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to Stonehenge .
0 Before long , you 're desperate for the evening to end .
0 The characters are never more than sketches ... which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach .
0 Mattei 's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from Stock Character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination .
1 Only in its final surprising shots does Rabbit-Proof Fence find the authority it 's looking for .
0 Is n't as sharp as the original ... Despite some visual virtues , ` Blade II ' just does n't cut it .
0 ... plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer -LRB- and -RRB- the director ca n't seem to get a coherent rhythm going .
0 In fact , it does n't even seem like she tried .
0 Maybe LeBlanc thought , `` Hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . ''
0 What you expect is just what you get ... assuming the bar of expectations has n't been raised above sixth-grade height .
1 Barry Sonnenfeld owes Frank the Pug big time
0 The biggest problem with Roger Avary 's uproar against the MPAA is that , even in all its director 's cut glory , he 's made a film that 's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything .
1 So riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along .
0 I approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise .
1 If Sinise 's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over .
0 Too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one .
0 There 's a reason the studio did n't offer an advance screening .
0 `` The Adventures of Pluto Nash '' is a big time stinker .
1 A punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters .
1 Takes one character we do n't like and another we do n't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is n't very funny .
0 The things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just wo n't fly with most intelligent viewers .
0 Even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity did n't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it would be rendered tedious by Avary 's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest .
1 Sitting through the last reel -LRB- spoiler alert ! -RRB-
0 is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his Halloween trip to the Haunted House .
0 Confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .
0 Deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel .
1 With this new Rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment .
0 One can only assume that the jury who bestowed star Hoffman 's brother Gordy with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting award at 2001 's Sundance Festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
0 A movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist 's waiting room , complete with soothing Muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms .
0 Sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler .
2 But never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
0 The script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that does n't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people .
0 A portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers .
0 The code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute .
0 Skip the film and buy the Philip Glass soundtrack CD .
0 Feels like a cold old man going through the motions .
0 Dignified CEO 's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree .
2 Can you bear the laughter ?
1 Dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
0 There 's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of Joan 's prefeminist plight , so we 're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity .
0 Beware the quirky Brit-com .
2 They can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental .
2 Has its moments -- and almost as many subplots .
0 The gags , and the script , are a mixed bag .
0 Completely awful Iranian drama ... as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque .
0 Narratively , Trouble Every Day is a plodding mess .
0 There 's no point in extracting the bare bones of Byatt 's plot for purposes of bland Hollywood romance .
1 Directors John Musker and Ron Clements , the team behind The Little Mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they are n't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space .
0 Adam Sandler 's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
1 There 's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan , but it 's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted .
0 Despite engaging offbeat touches , Knockaround Guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that 's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast .
1 It 's all pretty tame .
0 The most offensive thing about the movie is that Hollywood expects people to pay to see it .
0 The movie is a mess from start to finish .
0 The trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness .
1 I 'm not saying that Ice Age does n't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there 's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life .
1 In the telling of a story largely untold , Bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar .
0 The plot is nothing but boilerplate clichés from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
0 Terminally brain dead production .
0 Some episodes work , some do n't .
2 Beautifully filmed and well acted ... but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics .
2 J. Lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : She 's a pretty woman , but she 's no working girl .
0 Rymer does n't trust laughs -- and does n't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects .
0 Not only are the film 's Sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this ` we 're - doing-it-for - the-cash ' sequel were .
2 Wow .
0 I have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time .
0 Off the Hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director Adam Watstein with finishing it at all .
0 It 's a drag how Nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding .
1 Watching Harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but Boyd 's film offers little else of consequence .
0 It 's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed Antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget .
0 Will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2001 .
1 The problem is not that it 's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes .
0 The problem is that Van Wilder does little that is actually funny with the material .
0 There 's nothing interesting in Unfaithful whatsoever .
0 None of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think .
0 A processed comedy chop suey .
1 As spent screen series go , Star Trek : Nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there 's nothing to drink .
0 Fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of Fahrenheit 450 , and even as a rip-off of The Matrix .
0 Full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in .
0 An erotic thriller that 's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either .
0 The movie , like Bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 82 minutes .
0 With its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... Margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake .
0 If you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash .
1 The director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of New Age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast is n't the least bit mesmerizing .
1 Everything is pegged into the groove of a New York dating comedy with ` issues ' to simplify .
0 A dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any Hollywood fluff .
1 The cameo-packed , M : I-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise ... Then Mike Myers shows up and ruins everything .
1 It comes off as so silly that you would n't be surprised if BA , Murdock and rest of the A-Team were seen giving chase in a black and red van .
0 The 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about .
2 So genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen .
1 It never is , not fully .
0 Even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities .
0 What with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time .
0 As gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film 's creepy , clean-cut Dahmer -LRB- Jeremy Renner -RRB- and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge .
0 Plodding , peevish and gimmicky .
2 The Four Feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox .
1 Oozes condescension from every pore .
0 `` Solaris '' is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work .
0 The direction , by George Hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism .
2 Though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch .
2 It has plenty of laughs .
1 It just does n't have much else ... especially in a moral sense .
0 An awful lot like one of -LRB- Spears ' -RRB- music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it .
0 Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .
0 -LRB- H -RRB- ad I suffered and bled on the hard ground of Ia Drang , I 'd want something a bit more complex than We Were Soldiers to be remembered by .
0 Occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
1 it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like My Big Fat Greek Wedding
0 By the time you reach the finale , you 're likely wondering why you 've been watching all this strutting and posturing .
0 Journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull .
0 Putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a Pandora 's Box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest .
2 At its best , it 's Black Hawk Down with more heart .
1 At its worst , it 's Rambo - meets-John Ford .
1 Exactly what you 'd expect from a guy named Kaos .
0 This movie ... does n't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is .
0 With or without ballast tanks , K-19 sinks to a Harrison Ford low .
1 Director Oliver Parker labors so hard to whip life into The Importance of Being Earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two .
1 You might be shocked to discover that Seinfeld 's real life is boring .
2 It 's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time .
1 Walsh ca n't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in Janice 's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm .
0 This 10th film in the series looks and feels tired .
0 It leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject .
0 I found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as Vincent became more and more abhorrent .
1 One of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history .
0 There 's nothing to gain from watching They .
0 It is n't scary .
0 It hates its characters .
0 It finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers .
2 Fear permeates the whole of Stortelling , Todd Solondz ' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique .
0 The skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense .
1 ... Ice Age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that wo n't win many fans over the age of 11 .
2 Though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable .
0 Just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience .
1 The video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being ` naturalistic ' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it 's exhausting to watch .
0 A cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary .
1 It gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff .
0 An achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses .
0 It 's Tommy 's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you 'll feel like mopping up , too .
0 Rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a Hubert Selby Jr. , but there is n't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it 's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative .
0 Such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show .
0 If you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign .
0 An EXIT sign , that is .
1 Holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp .
0 The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
1 A feature-length , R-rated , road-trip version of Mama 's Family .
1 What you end up getting is the Vertical Limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between .
0 Stealing Harvard does n't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor .
0 Bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly .
2 There 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
0 Imagine Kevin Smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban Jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor .
1 The result might look like Vulgar .
0 Suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as Dahmer demands .
0 What soured me on The Santa Clause 1 was that Santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it 's icky .
0 It 's an 88-minute highlight reel that 's 86 minutes too long .
1 The film favors the scientific over the spectacular -LRB- visually speaking -RRB- .
0 Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .
0 With the exception of McCoist , the players do n't have a clue on the park .
0 The acting is n't much better .
1 The whole affair is as predictable as can be .
0 A not-so-Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood with a hefty helping of Re-Fried Green Tomatoes .
0 This cloying , voices-from-the-other-side story is hell .
2 A suffocating rape-payback horror show that hinges on the subgenre 's most enabling victim ... and an ebullient affection for industrial-model meat freezers .
0 Star Trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy .
0 -LRB- N -RRB- o matter how much good will the actors generate , Showtime eventually folds under its own thinness .
1 Every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of Rohypnol .
0 Puts on airs of a Hal Hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself .
0 Ver Wiel 's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of Critical Jim two-dimensional and pointless .
1 Despite a performance of sustained intelligence from Stanford and another of subtle humour from Bebe Neuwirth , as an older woman who seduces Oscar , the film founders on its lack of empathy for the social milieu - rich New York intelligentsia - and its off
0 Although Disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual .
0 Gaghan ... has thrown every suspenseful cliché in the book at this nonsensical story .
0 A sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis .
2 -LRB- P -RRB- artnering Murphy with Robert De Niro for the TV-cops comedy Showtime would seem to be surefire casting .
0 The catch is that they 're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders .
1 ` You 'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied .
0 You 'll feel like you ate a Reeses without the peanut butter ... '
0 Gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance .
1 Parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone ... that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story 's core .
1 The director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn .
0 The results are far more alienating than involving .
0 Bogdanich is unashamedly pro-Serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side .
1 A lack of thesis makes Maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special .
0 Without Shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish .
1 If H.G. Wells had a time machine and could take a look at his kin 's reworked version , what would he say ?
0 ` It looks good , Sonny , but you missed the point . '
0 During The Tuxedo 's 90 minutes of screen time , there is n't one true ` Chan moment ' .
1 Bisset delivers a game performance , but she is unable to save the movie .
2 Watching Austin Powers in Goldmember is like binging on cotton candy .
0 It 's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied .
1 The most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 Miles to Graceland .
0 The film can depress you about life itself .
0 I 'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap cliché .
0 The acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the Wal-Mart checkout line .
0 Its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers .
1 The plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before Janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel .
0 Sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely .
0 At 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer .
1 Here 's my advice , Kev .
0 Start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line .
0 An alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom ... you 'd be wise to send your regrets .
0 An ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental .
0 Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .
1 Especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie .
1 It wraps up a classic mother\/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .
0 Glazed with a tawdry B-movie scum .
0 This is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .
0 It winds up moving in many directions as it searches -LRB- vainly , I think -RRB- for something fresh to say .
2 All in all , Road to Perdition is more in love with strangeness than excellence .
0 A big fat pain .
0 A mimetic approximation of better films like Contempt and 8 1\/1 .
1 Unintelligible , poorly acted , brain-slappingly bad , Harvard Man is ludicrous enough that it could become a cult classic .
2 Watching The Powerpuff Girls Movie , my mind kept returning to one anecdote for comparison : the cartoon in Japan that gave people seizures .
0 An inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director 's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength .
0 To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .
0 With the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which They is n't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright .
1 Mild , meandering teen flick .
1 Though its atmosphere is intriguing ... the drama is finally too predictable to leave much of an impression .
0 Though this rude and crude film does deliver a few gut-busting laughs , its digs at modern society are all things we 've seen before .
0 Although it tries to be much more , it 's really just another Major League .
0 Astonishing is n't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap .
1 Indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild .
1 One thing is for sure : This movie does not tell you a whole lot about Lily Chou-Chou .
0 With a tone as variable as the cinematography , Schaeffer 's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters ' quirks and foibles never jell into charm .
0 To better understand why this did n't connect with me would require another viewing , and I wo n't be sitting through this one again ... that in itself is commentary enough .
0 Cuba Gooding Jr. valiantly mugs his way through Snow Dogs , but even his boisterous energy fails to spark this leaden comedy .
0 Diane Lane 's sophisticated performance ca n't rescue Adrian Lyne 's Unfaithful from its sleazy moralizing .
0 Not at all clear what it 's trying to say and even if it were -- I doubt it would be all that interesting .
0 -LRB- Swimfan -RRB- falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting .
0 This remake of Lina Wertmuller 's 1975 eroti-comedy might just be the biggest husband-and-wife disaster since John and Bo Derek made the ridiculous Bolero .
1 Silly , loud and goofy .
0 Why spend $ 9 on the same stuff you can get for a buck or so in that greasy little vidgame pit in the theater lobby ?
0 The French director has turned out nearly 21\/1 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing .
0 The basic premise is intriguing but quickly becomes distasteful and downright creepy .
0 The Pool drowned me in boredom .
0 It 's like an all-star salute to Disney 's cheesy commercialism .
0 It 's hard to imagine any recent film , independent or otherwise , that makes as much of a mess as this one .
0 Some of the computer animation is handsome , and various amusing sidekicks add much-needed levity to the otherwise bleak tale , but overall the film never rises above mediocrity .
0 There 's an excellent 90-minute film here ; unfortunately , it runs for 170 .
0 As saccharine movies go , this is likely to cause massive cardiac arrest if taken in large doses .
1 Die Another Day is only intermittently entertaining but it 's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it 's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with .
0 As is often the case with ambitious , eager first-time filmmakers , Mr. Murray , a prolific director of music videos , stuffs his debut with more plot than it can comfortably hold .
0 The mystery of Enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent ... could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture .
2 It throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , `` Look at this !
2 This is an interesting movie ! ''
0 But the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging .
0 The inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror\/action hybrid .
0 It 's not only dull because we 've seen -LRB- Eddie -RRB- Murphy do the genial-rogue shtick to death , but because the plot is equally hackneyed .
1 Avary 's film never quite emerges from the shadow of Ellis ' book .
1 A poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda .
0 While it is interesting to witness the conflict from the Palestinian side , Longley 's film lacks balance ... and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .
0 Woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the `` Saving Private Ryan '' battle scenes before realizing Steven Spielberg got it right the first time ?
1 It 's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .
1 ... Jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just is n't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead 's specific gifts .
1 This follow-up seems so similar to the 1952 Disney classic that it makes one long for a geriatric Peter .
0 Why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the TV cow is free ?
0 There 's no good answer to that one .
1 This slow-moving Swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of Martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .
0 A muddled limp biscuit of a movie , a vampire soap opera that does n't make much sense even on its own terms .
0 There 's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .
0 This is a movie so insecure about its capacity to excite that it churns up not one but two flagrantly fake thunderstorms to underscore the action .
1 This is amusing for about three minutes .
0 Klein , charming in comedies like American Pie and dead-on in Election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed .
0 It 's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from `` promising '' to `` interesting '' to `` familiar '' before landing squarely on `` stupid '' .
0 This is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video -- with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes .
0 The direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why .
0 There are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending .
1 It wo n't harm anyone , but neither can I think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it .
0 After all , it 'll probably be in video stores by Christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies .
0 Looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights .
0 Given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors ' workshop that it is .
0 They kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who have n't read the book .
0 Just because A Walk to Remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough for our girls .
0 -LRB- Carvey 's -RRB- characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark .
0 It 's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar American style of justice that plays out here , but it 's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through .
0 This dreadfully earnest inversion of the Concubine love triangle eschews the previous film 's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .
1 Brown 's saga , like many before his , makes for snappy prose but a stumblebum of a movie .

1 John Carlen 's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling .
1 LaBute ca n't avoid a fatal mistake in the modern era : He 's changed the male academic from a lower-class Brit to an American , a choice that upsets the novel 's exquisite balance and shreds the fabric of the film .

1 Bond-inspired ?
1 Certainly .
2 Likely to have decades of life as a classic movie franchise ?
1 Let 's hope not .
0 This flat run at a hip-hop Tootsie is so poorly paced you could fit all of Pootie Tang in between its punchlines .
1 Davis has energy , but she does n't bother to make her heroine 's book sound convincing , the gender-war ideas original , or the comic scenes fly .
0 Surprisingly , considering that Baird is a former film editor , the movie is rather choppy .

1 These two are generating about as much chemistry as an Iraqi factory poised to receive a UN inspector .
0 Just as the lousy Tarantino imitations have subsided , here comes the first lousy Guy Ritchie imitation .
1 A passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .
0 The movie attempts to mine laughs from a genre -- the gangster\/crime comedy -- that wore out its welcome with audiences several years ago , and its cutesy reliance on movie-specific cliches is n't exactly endearing .
0 shows Holmes has the screen presence to become a major-league leading lady , -LRB- but -RRB- the movie itself is an underachiever , a psychological mystery that takes its sweet time building to a climax that 's scarcely a surprise by the time it arrives .
0 Ultimately ... the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .
1 It 's just a little too self-satisfied .
1 Clever but not especially compelling .
0 McKay seems embarrassed by his own invention and tries to rush through the intermediary passages , apparently hoping that the audience will not notice the glaring triteness of the plot device he has put in service .
0 A piece of mildly entertaining , inoffensive fluff that drifts aimlessly for 90 minutes before lodging in the cracks of that ever-growing category : unembarrassing but unmemorable .
1 LaBute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public .
0 The movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne .

2 Alarms for Duvall 's throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks .
0 What little grace -LRB- Rifkin 's -RRB- tale of precarious skid-row dignity achieves is pushed into the margins by predictable plotting and tiresome histrionics .
0 Tries to work in the same vein as the brilliance of Animal House but instead comes closer to the failure of the third Revenge of the Nerds sequel .

0 None of this so-called satire has any sting to it , as if Woody is afraid of biting the hand that has finally , to some extent , warmed up to him .
2 A few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics are n't likely to enter the theater .
1 Bad in such a bizarre way that it 's almost worth seeing , if only to witness the crazy confluence of purpose and taste .
0 There 's more repetition than creativity throughout the movie .
2 Hugh Grant 's act is so consuming that sometimes it 's difficult to tell who the other actors in the movie are .
0 Although the sequel has all the outward elements of the original , the first film 's lovely flakiness is gone , replaced by the forced funniness found in the dullest kiddie flicks .
0 I 've had more interesting -- and , dare I say , thematically complex -- bowel movements than this long-on-the-shelf , point-and-shoot exercise in gimmicky crime drama .
1 What we get ... is Caddyshack crossed with the Loyal Order of Raccoons .
0 The jokes are flat , and the action looks fake .
0 When a movie asks you to feel sorry for Mick Jagger 's sex life , it already has one strike against it .

0 Gussied up with so many distracting special effects and visual party tricks that it 's not clear whether we 're supposed to shriek or laugh .
0 Plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo .
0 This is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life .
0 A baffling subplot involving smuggling drugs inside Danish cows falls flat , and if you 're going to alter the Bard 's ending , you 'd better have a good alternative .
1 Soderbergh seems capable only of delivering artfully lighted , earnest inquiries that lack the kind of genuine depth that would make them redeemable .

2 As an actress , Madonna is one helluva singer .
0 As the Mediterranean sparkles , ` Swept Away ' sinks .

1 Expanded to 65 minutes for theatrical release , it still feels somewhat unfinished .
0 It all looks and plays like a $ 40 million version of a game you 're more likely to enjoy on a computer .
1 -LRB- Javier Bardem is -RRB- one of the few reasons to watch the film , which director Gerardo Vera has drenched in swoony music and fever-pitched melodrama .

0 No amount of blood and disintegrating vampire cadavers can obscure this movie 's lack of ideas .
1 A direct-to-void release , heading nowhere .
0 Typical animé , with cheapo animation -LRB- like Saturday morning TV in the '60s -RRB- , a complex sword-and-sorcery plot and characters who all have big round eyes and Japanese names .
0 Below is well below expectations .
1 At no point during K-19 : The Widowmaker did this viewer feel enveloped in a story that , though meant to be universal in its themes of loyalty , courage and dedication to a common goal , never seems to leave the lot .
2 ... standard guns versus martial arts cliche with little new added .
0 Empire ca n't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film .

1 Viewed as a comedy , a romance , a fairy tale , or a drama , there 's nothing remotely triumphant about this motion picture .
0 There 's something unintentionally comic in the film 's drumbeat about authenticity , given the stale plot and pornographic way the film revels in swank apartments , clothes and parties .
1 The Master of Disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha '' funny , `` dead circus performer '' funny .
0 And for all the wrong reasons besides .
0 A zippy 96 minutes of mediocre special effects , hoary dialogue , fluxing accents , and -- worst of all -- silly-looking Morlocks .
0 A 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor .
0 You leave feeling like you 've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing .
0 The waterlogged script plumbs uncharted depths of stupidity , incoherence and sub-sophomoric sexual banter .
0 With McConaughey in an entirely irony-free zone and Bale reduced mainly to batting his sensitive eyelids , there 's not enough intelligence , wit or innovation on the screen to attract and sustain an older crowd .
1 It 's the type of stunt the Academy loves : a powerful political message stuffed into an otherwise mediocre film .
0 In theory , a middle-aged romance pairing Clayburgh and Tambor sounds promising , but in practice it 's something else altogether -- clownish and offensive and nothing at all like real life .
0 So mind-numbingly awful that you hope Britney wo n't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned .
1 The images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where Whitaker 's misfit artist is concerned .

0 Sets animation back 30 years , musicals back 40 years and Judaism back at least 50 .
0 Weirdly , Broomfield has compelling new material but he does n't unveil it until the end , after endless scenes of him wheedling reluctant witnesses and pointing his camera through the smeared windshield of his rental car .
1 Might best be enjoyed as a daytime soaper .
2 eventually arrives at its heart , as simple self-reflection meditation .

0 Most of the storylines feel like time fillers between surf shots .
1 The movie is n't horrible , but you can see mediocre cresting on the next wave .

0 There 's nothing remotely topical or sexy here .
0 The Tuxedo was n't just bad ; it was , as my friend David Cross would call it , ` Hungry-Man portions of bad ' .

1 Reeks of rot and hack work from start to finish .
1 An exhausting family drama about a porcelain empire and just as hard a flick as its subject matter .
2 Woody Allen has really found his groove these days .

0 It 's such a mechanical endeavor -LRB- that -RRB- it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it .

0 If the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish .
0 Ultimately , in the history of the Academy , people may be wondering what all that jazz was about `` Chicago '' in 2001 .

0 Its plot and animation offer daytime TV serviceability , but little more .
0 A tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre .
0 Human Nature , in short , is n't nearly as funny as it thinks it is ; neither is it as smart .
2 A film with a great premise but only a great premise .
0 Instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .
0 Kirshner and Monroe seem to be in a contest to see who can out-bad-act the other .

0 It 's clotted with heavy-handed symbolism , dime-store psychology and endless scenic shots that make 105 minutes seem twice as long .
0 A fifty car pileup of cliches .
0 It 's a stale , overused cocktail using the same olives since 1961 as garnish .
0 Not only is entry number twenty the worst of the Brosnan bunch , it 's one of the worst of the entire franchise .

1 As crimes go , writer-director Michael Kalesniko 's How to Kill Your Neighbor 's Dog is slight but unendurable .
0 There must be an audience that enjoys the Friday series , but I would n't be interested in knowing any of them personally .
2 A bold -LRB- and lovely -RRB- experiment that will almost certainly bore most audiences into their own brightly colored dreams .
1 An uplifting , largely bogus story .
0 An empty exercise , a florid but ultimately vapid crime melodrama with lots of surface flash but little emotional resonance .
0 If you are curious to see the darker side of what 's going on with young TV actors -LRB- Dawson Leery did what ?!? -RRB- , or see some interesting storytelling devices , you might want to check it out , but there 's nothing very attractive about this movie .
0 My own minority report is that it stinks .
0 Trying to make head or tail of the story in the hip-hop indie Snipes is enough to give you brain strain -- and the pay-off is negligible .
2 The script is high on squaddie banter , low on shocks .
0 ... if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you 're in for a painful ride .
0 While Solondz tries and tries hard , Storytelling fails to provide much more insight than the inside column of a torn book jacket .
0 With very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like Swimming With Sharks and The Player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .
0 -LRB- Davis -RRB- wants to cause his audience an epiphany , yet he refuses to give us real situations and characters .
0 Without a fresh infusion of creativity , 4Ever is neither a promise nor a threat so much as wishful thinking .
0 ... unlike -LRB- Scorsese 's Mean Streets -RRB- , Ash Wednesday is essentially devoid of interesting characters or even a halfway intriguing plot .
0 Being unique does n't necessarily equate to being good , no matter how admirably the filmmakers have gone for broke .
0 A few hours after you 've seen it , you forget you 've been to the movies .
2 waydowntown may not be an important movie , or even a good one , but it provides a nice change of mindless pace in collision with the hot Oscar season currently underway .
0 Yes , I suppose it 's lovely that Cal works out his issues with his dad and comes to terms with his picture-perfect life -- but World Traveler gave me no reason to care , so I did n't .
1 Shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating Patch Adams , trots out every ghost trick from The Sixth Sense to The Mothman Prophecies .
1 The photographer 's show-don ` t-tell stance is admirable , but it can make him a problematic documentary subject .
0 It is not the first time that director Sara Sugarman stoops to having characters drop their pants for laughs and not the last time she fails to provoke them .
0 I 'd be hard pressed to think of a film more cloyingly sappy than Evelyn this year .
0 Nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a loosely-connected string of acting-workshop exercises .
1 meanders between its powerful moments .
0 What remains is a variant of the nincompoop Benigni persona , here a more annoying , though less angry version of the irresponsible Sandlerian manchild , undercut by the voice of the star of Road Trip .
0 A backhanded ode to female camaraderie penned by a man who has little clue about either the nature of women or of friendship .
1 Pure of intention and passably diverting , His Secret Life is light , innocuous and unremarkable .
1 ... delivers few moments of inspiration amid the bland animation and simplistic story .

0 It 's got the brawn , but not the brains .
0 Mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline .
0 A lot of talent is wasted in this crass , low-wattage endeavor .
1 To show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree .
0 -LRB- T -RRB- oo many of these gross out scenes ...
0 About one in three gags in White 's intermittently wise script hits its mark ; the rest are padding unashamedly appropriated from the teen-exploitation playbook .
0 Little is done to support the premise other than fling gags at it to see which ones shtick .
1 Reno does what he can in a thankless situation , the film ricochets from humor to violence and back again , and Ryoko Hirosue makes us wonder if she is always like that .
1 If Jews were Catholics , this would be Catechism
0 One of those films that seems tailor made to air on pay cable to offer some modest amusements when one has nothing else to watch .
2 The big ending surprise almost saves the movie .
1 It 's too bad that the rest is n't more compelling .
1 Charming , if overly complicated ...
1 Schneider 's mugging is relentless and his constant need to suddenly transpose himself into another character undermines the story 's continuity and progression .
1 All very stylish and beautifully photographed , but far more trouble than it 's worth , with fantasy mixing with reality and actors playing more than one role just to add to the confusion .
0 It 's probably not easy to make such a worthless film ...
1 Hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it does n't .
0 Has no reason to exist , other than to employ Hollywood kids and people who owe favors to their famous parents .
0 For a guy who has waited three years with breathless anticipation for a new Hal Hartley movie to pore over , No Such Thing is a big letdown .
0 Constantly slips from the grasp of its maker .
1 Smothered by its own solemnity .
0 ` Christian Bale 's Quinn -LRB- is -RRB- a leather clad grunge-pirate with a hairdo like Gandalf in a wind-tunnel and a simply astounding cor-blimey-luv-a-duck cockney accent . '
1 Might be one of those vanity projects in which a renowned filmmaker attempts to show off his talent by surrounding himself with untalented people .
0 After you laugh once -LRB- maybe twice -RRB- , you will have completely forgotten the movie by the time you get back to your car in the parking lot .
1 Not one moment in the enterprise did n't make me want to lie down in a dark room with something cool to my brow .
0 In the era of The Sopranos , it feels painfully redundant and inauthentic .
0 The overall vibe is druggy and self-indulgent , like a spring-break orgy for pretentious arts majors .
0 Breen 's script is sketchy with actorish notations on the margin of acting .
1 There 's no question that Epps scores once or twice , but it 's telling that his funniest moment comes when he falls about ten feet onto his head .
0 If only Merchant paid more attention the story .
0 At the one-hour mark , Herzog simply runs out of ideas and the pace turns positively leaden as the movie sputters to its inevitable tragic conclusion .
0 ... too contrived to be as naturally charming as it needs to be .
0 A simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something .
0 The characters are based on stock clichés , and the attempt to complicate the story only defies credibility .
0 Everything about it from the bland songs to the colorful but flat drawings is completely serviceable and quickly forgettable .
2 Not the Great American Comedy , but if you liked the previous movies in the series , you 'll have a good time with this one too .
0 A domestic melodrama with weak dialogue and biopic cliches .
0 Mr. Goyer 's loose , unaccountable direction is technically sophisticated in the worst way .
2 The movie is so thoughtlessly assembled .
1 Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio , complete with receding hairline , weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer 's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice .
0 plays like some corny television production from a bygone era
0 The end result is like cold porridge with only the odd enjoyably chewy lump .
2 For all the charm of Kevin Kline and a story that puts old-fashioned values under the microscope , there 's something creepy about this movie .
0 I was feeling this movie until it veered off too far into the Exxon zone , and left me behind at the station looking for a return ticket to realism .
2 Producer John Penotti surveyed high school students ... and came back with the astonishing revelation that `` they wanted to see something that did n't talk down to them . ''
0 Ignoring that , he made Swimfan anyway
0 Naipaul fans may be disappointed .
0 Those who are not acquainted with the author 's work , on the other hand , may fall fast asleep .
0 Hoffman waits too long to turn his movie in an unexpected direction , and even then his tone retains a genteel , prep-school quality that feels dusty and leatherbound .
1 If you 're a Crocodile Hunter fan , you 'll enjoy at least the `` real '' portions of the film .
0 If you 're looking for a story , do n't bother .
0 Full Frontal had no effect and elicited no sympathies for any of the characters .
0 By that measure , it is a failure .
0 A baffling mixed platter of gritty realism and magic realism with a hard-to-swallow premise .
0 An affable but undernourished romantic comedy that fails to match the freshness of the actress-producer and writer 's previous collaboration , Miss Congeniality .
1 Sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it does n't .
0 Like a pack of dynamite sticks , built for controversy .
1 The film is explosive , but a few of those sticks are wet .
1 Has its charming quirks and its dull spots .
0 An admitted egomaniac , Evans is no Hollywood villain , and yet this grating showcase almost makes you wish he 'd gone the way of Don Simpson .
0 The audience when I saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that 's a bad sign when they 're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .
0 Everyone 's to blame here .
0 You get the impression that writer and director Burr Steers knows the territory ... but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools .
0 Less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .
0 Rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them .
1 It 's a bizarre curiosity memorable mainly for the way it fritters away its potentially interesting subject matter via a banal script , unimpressive acting and indifferent direction .
1 A slight and obvious effort , even for one whose target demographic is likely still in the single digits , age-wise .
1 Sex With Strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness .
0 But what is missing from it all is a moral .
1 What is the filmmakers ' point ?
0 Why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ?
1 You see Robin Williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm .
0 You see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz .
0 Downright transparent is the script 's endless assault of embarrassingly ham-fisted sex jokes that reek of a script rewrite designed to garner the film a `` cooler '' PG-12 rating .
0 The movie slides downhill as soon as macho action conventions assert themselves .
0 Formulaic to the 51st power , more like .
1 Draggin ' about dragons
0 Howard and his co-stars all give committed performances , but they 're often undone by Howard 's self-conscious attempts to find a ` literary ' filmmaking style to match his subject .
1 A respectable but uninspired thriller that 's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact .
1 Jones helps breathe some life into the insubstantial plot , but even he is overwhelmed by predictability .
1 The movie just has too much on its plate to really stay afloat for its just under ninety minute running time .
0 Comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .
0 Offers absolutely nothing I had n't already seen .
0 `` Analyze That '' is one of those crass , contrived sequels that not only fails on its own , but makes you second-guess your affection for the original .
1 You might say Tykwer has done all that Heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-Kieslowski a pun as possible .
0 Suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .
0 Complex , sinuously plotted and , somehow , off-puttingly cold .
2 First-time writer-director Dylan Kidd also has a good ear for dialogue , and the characters sound like real people .
0 ... an airless , prepackaged Julia Roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you 'll wonder if Lopez 's publicist should share screenwriting credit .
0 Goldmember has none of the visual wit of the previous pictures , and it looks as though Jay Roach directed the film from the back of a taxicab .
0 Could as easily have been called ` Under Siege 2 : In Alcatraz ' ... a cinematic corpse that never springs to life .
0 In comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class London life ; despite the title ... amounts to surprisingly little .
0 Lame Sweet Home leaves no Southern stereotype unturned .
1 Slow , dry , poorly cast , but beautifully shot .
0 The jokes are sophomoric , stereotypes are sprinkled everywhere and the acting ranges from bad to bodacious .
2 Will give many ministers and Bible-study groups hours of material to discuss .
0 But mainstream audiences will find little of interest in this film , which is often preachy and poorly acted .
0 In its chicken heart , Crush goes to absurd lengths to duck the very issues it raises .
0 This long and relentlessly saccharine film is a clear case of preaching to the converted .
0 The film is flat .
0 The movie is a lumbering load of hokum but ... it 's at least watchable .
1 It 's a boom-box of a movie that might have been titled ` The Loud and the Ludicrous ' ... the pandering to a moviegoing audience dominated by young males is all too calculated .
0 An unbelievably stupid film , though occasionally fun enough to make you forget its absurdity .
0 The first Fatal Attraction was vile enough .
0 Do we really need the Tiger Beat version ?
0 This Bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better .
0 The problem is that the movie has no idea of it is serious or not .
0 When the fire burns out , we 've only come face-to-face with a couple dragons and that 's where the film ultimately fails .
1 It would work much better as a one-hour TV documentary .
0 The elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat .
1 Anemic chronicle of money grubbing New Yorkers and their serial loveless hook ups .
1 Simply does n't have sufficient heft to justify its two-hour running time .
0 An unsuccessful attempt at a movie of ideas .
0 Queen of the Damned as you might have guessed , makes sorry use of Aaliyah in her one and only starring role -- she does little here but point at things that explode into flame .
0 This toothless Dog , already on cable , loses all bite on the big screen .
0 It made me feel unclean , and I 'm the guy who liked There 's Something About Mary and both American Pie movies .
1 Oh , and Booty Call .
0 Not only is it hokey , manipulative and as bland as Wonder Bread dipped in milk , but it also does the absolute last thing we need Hollywood doing to us : It preaches .
0 It 's so crammed with scenes and vistas and pretty moments that it 's left a few crucial things out , like character development and coherence .
0 Serving Sara should be served an eviction notice at every theater stuck with it .
1 Director Roger Michell does so many of the little things right that it 's difficult not to cuss him out severely for bungling the big stuff .
0 A loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism ` urban drama . '
0 The movie has a script -LRB- by Paul Pender -RRB- made of wood , and it 's relentlessly folksy , a procession of stagy set pieces stacked with binary oppositions .
0 A pathetic exploitation film that tries to seem sincere , and just seems worse for the effort .
0 At some point , all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy , vaguely silly overkill .
0 Despite some charm and heart , this quirky soccer import is forgettable
0 Meyjes 's movie , like Max Rothman 's future , does not work .
0 What 's needed so badly but what is virtually absent here is either a saving dark humor or the feel of poetic tragedy .
0 Schneidermeister ... Makin ' a fool of himself ... Losin ' his fan base ...
1 An ambitious , serious film that manages to do virtually everything wrong ; sitting through it is something akin to an act of cinematic penance .
0 Not once does it come close to being exciting .
1 A Frankenstein mishmash that careens from dark satire to cartoonish slapstick , Bartleby performs neither one very well .
1 It plays like a big-budget , after-school special with a generous cast , who at times lift the material from its well-meaning clunkiness .
1 There 's something not entirely convincing about The Quiet American .
1 And that holds true for both the movie and the title character played by Brendan Fraser .
0 One of those strained caper movies that 's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
0 Needed a little less bling-bling and a lot more romance .
1 The ending does n't work ... but most of the movie works so well I 'm almost recommending it , anyway -- maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with a curiosity about how a movie can go very right , and then step wrong .
0 It 's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before .
0 I 'm not exactly sure what this movie thinks it is about .
0 Cal is an unpleasantly shallow and immature character with whom to spend 110 claustrophobic minutes .
1 So brisk is Wang 's pacing that none of the excellent cast are given air to breathe .
0 The bottom line , at least in my opinion , is Imposter makes a better short story than it does a film .
1 Some elements of it really blow the big one , but other parts are decent .
0 It is just too bad the film 's story does not live up to its style .
0 Unless you 're a fanatic , the best advice is : ` Scooby ' do n't .
0 A cautionary tale about the folly of superficiality that is itself endlessly superficial .
1 For single digits kidlets Stuart Little 1 is still a no brainer .
0 If you 're looking to rekindle the magic of the first film , you 'll need a stronger stomach than us .
0 Shreve 's graceful dual narrative gets clunky on the screen , and we keep getting torn away from the compelling historical tale to a less-compelling soap opera .
0 Contains a few big laughs but many more that graze the funny bone or miss it altogether , in part because the consciously dumbed-down approach wears thin .
0 Nothing more than a widget cranked out on an assembly line to see if stupid Americans will get a kick out of goofy Brits with cute accents performing ages-old slapstick and unfunny tricks .
0 This is a film tailor-made for those who when they were in high school would choose the Cliff-Notes over reading a full-length classic .
0 The movie is undone by a filmmaking methodology that 's just experimental enough to alienate the mainstream audience while ringing cliched to hardened indie-heads .
0 A jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages .
0 A sad and rote exercise in milking a played-out idea -- a straight guy has to dress up in drag -- that shockingly manages to be even worse than its title would imply .
1 Personal Velocity ought to be exploring these women 's inner lives , but it never moves beyond their surfaces .
0 We hate -LRB- Madonna -RRB- within the film 's first five minutes , and she lacks the skill or presence to regain any ground .
0 Sounding like Arnold Schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , -LRB- Ahola -RRB- has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that does n't produce any real transformation .
0 Two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
1 A fascinating but choppy documentary .
0 Scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company .
1 The doofus-on - the-loose banter of Welcome to Collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it .
0 And as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content is n't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is .
0 Too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .
0 Apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap .
0 The sinister inspiration that fuelled DeVito 's early work is confused in Death to Smoochy into something both ugly and mindless .
0 Despite Auteuil 's performance , it 's a rather listless amble down the middle of the road , where the thematic ironies are too obvious and the sexual politics too smug .
1 Director Boris von Sychowski instead opts for a routine slasher film that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through .
1 ... little more than a well-acted television melodrama shot for the big screen .
0 Never comes together as a coherent whole .
0 An unintentionally surreal kid 's picture ... in which actors in bad bear suits enact a sort of inter-species parody of a VH0 Behind the Music episode .
0 First , for a movie that tries to be smart , it 's kinda dumb .
0 And second , what 's with all the shooting ?
0 Do n't even bother to rent this on video .
0 There is something in Full Frontal , I guess , about artifice and acting and how it distorts reality for people who make movies and watch them , but like most movie riddles , it works only if you have an interest in the characters you see .
0 This is the kind of movie that gets a quick release before real contenders arrive in September .
0 Not counting a few gross-out comedies I 've been trying to forget , this is the first film in a long time that made me want to bolt the theater in the first 10 minutes .
0 Plays like one long , meandering sketch inspired by the works of John Waters and Todd Solondz , rather than a fully developed story .
0 The film does n't have enough innovation or pizazz to attract teenagers , and it lacks the novel charm that made Spy Kids a surprising winner with both adults and younger audiences .
0 A mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird Masterpiece Theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being .
0 An average B-movie with no aspirations to be anything more .
1 Bartlett 's hero remains a reactive cipher , when opening the man 's head and heart is the only imaginable reason for the film to be made .
1 Gibney and Jarecki just want to string the bastard up .
0 The plot is plastered with one Hollywood cliche after another , most of which involve precocious kids getting the better of obnoxious adults .
1 Less worrying about covering all the drama in Frida 's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie .
0 A film that suffers because of its many excesses .
0 Too bland and fustily tasteful to be truly prurient .
0 In any case , I would recommend Big Bad Love only to Winger fans who have missed her since 1995 's Forget Paris .
0 But even then , I 'd recommend waiting for DVD and just skipping straight to her scenes .
0 Depicts the sorriest and most sordid of human behavior on the screen , then laughs at how clever it 's being .
0 Nijinsky says , ' I know how to suffer ' and if you see this film you 'll know too .
0 ` CQ may one day be fondly remembered as Roman Coppola 's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
0 The only thing scary about feardotcom is that the filmmakers and studio are brazen enough to attempt to pass this stinker off as a scary movie .
0 ... the story simply putters along looking for astute observations and coming up blank .
0 Instead of contriving a climactic hero 's death for the beloved-major - character-who-shall - remain-nameless , why not invite some genuine spontaneity into the film by having the evil aliens ' laser guns actually hit something for once ?
0 It just did n't mean much to me and played too skewed to ever get a hold on -LRB- or be entertained by -RRB- .
0 This action-thriller\/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage .
0 MIB II is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and\/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything .
0 That 's because relatively nothing happens .
0 No amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are ` German-Expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable .
0 Blue Crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling .
0 Boyd 's screenplay -LRB- co-written with Guardian hack Nick Davies -RRB- has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to Guy Ritchie than the Bard of Avon .
0 There 's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination .
0 Jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder .
0 A moving picture that does not move .
1 Ruh-roh !
0 Romething 's really wrong with this ricture !
0 Its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director Roger Avary .
0 I 'm not sure these words have ever been together in the same sentence : This erotic cannibal movie is boring .
0 ` God help us , but Capra and Cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
0 ... an hour-and-a-half of inoffensive , unmemorable filler .

0 It gets the details of its time frame right but it completely misses its emotions .
0 Who , exactly , is fighting whom here ?
0 Ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze .
0 A kilted Jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces .
0 Contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster .
0 Starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter .
0 The film lapses too often into sugary sentiment and withholds delivery on the pell-mell pyrotechnics its punchy style promises .
0 The only question ... is to determine how well the schmaltz is manufactured -- to assess the quality of the manipulative engineering .
0 Average , at best , I 'm afraid .
0 This movie is so bad , that it 's almost worth seeing because it 's so bad .
1 A crisply made movie that is no more than mildly amusing .
0 This movie feel more like a non-stop cry for attention , than an attempt at any kind of satisfying entertainment .
1 Overall , it 's a pretty mediocre family film .
0 Love may have been in the air onscreen , but I certainly was n't feeling any of it .
0 In addition to the overcooked , ham-fisted direction , which has all the actors reaching for the back row , the dialogue sounds like horrible poetry .
0 The very definition of what critics have come to term an `` ambitious failure . ''
0 It 's as if De Palma spent an hour setting a fancy table and then served up Kraft Macaroni and Cheese .
0 The movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter ` uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie .
0 Worthy of the gong .
0 While certainly more naturalistic than its Australian counterpart , Amari 's film falls short in building the drama of Lilia 's journey .
0 I found the movie as divided against itself as the dysfunctional family it portrays .
0 The soul-searching deliberateness of the film , although leavened nicely with dry absurdist wit , eventually becomes too heavy for the plot .
0 The movie does n't add anything fresh to the myth .
0 As inept as big-screen remakes of The Avengers and The Wild Wild West .
0 Comes across as a relic from a bygone era , and its convolutions ... feel silly rather than plausible .
0 Moves in such odd plot directions and descends into such message-mongering moralism that its good qualities are obscured .
2 It 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary .
0 Once one experiences Mr. Haneke 's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one 's mouth , and little else .
1 Oops , she 's really done it this time .
0 That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel .
0 It 's a loathsome movie , it really is and it makes absolutely no sense .
0 A chiller resolutely without chills .
0 For those of us who respond more strongly to storytelling than computer-generated effects , the new Star Wars installment has n't escaped the rut dug by the last one .
0 The director mostly plays it straight , turning Leys ' fable into a listless climb down the social ladder .
0 `` Bad '' is the operative word for `` Bad Company , '' and I do n't mean that in a good way .
0 Though Frida is easier to swallow than Julie Taymor 's preposterous Titus , the eye candy here lacks considerable brio .
2 Drumline is -- the mere suggestion , albeit a visually compelling one , of a fully realized story .
0 The whole movie is simply a lazy exercise in bad filmmaking that asks you to not only suspend your disbelief but your intelligence as well .
1 The film affords us intriguing glimpses of the insights gleaned from a lifetime of spiritual inquiry , but Ram Dass : Fierce Grace does n't organize it with any particular insight .
0 Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro sleepwalk through vulgarities in a sequel you can refuse .
0 It 's loud and boring ; watching it is like being trapped at a bad rock concert .
0 Merely -LRB- and literally -RRB- tosses around sex toys and offers half-hearted paeans to empowerment that are repeatedly undercut by the brutality of the jokes , most at women 's expense .
0 If you want a movie time trip , the 1960 version is a far smoother ride .
1 Traffics in the kind of prechewed racial clichés that have already been through the corporate stand-up-comedy mill .
0 The story is -- forgive me -- a little thin , and the filmmaking clumsy and rushed .
0 ... grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces .
1 I wish Windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story .
0 This would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .
0 Aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash .
2 Stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by Dustin Hoffman that is revelatory .
0 None of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .
1 As social exposé , Skins has its heart in the right place , but that 's not much to hang a soap opera on .
0 The whole film has this sneaky feel to it -- as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as Very Important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a Hollywood product .
1 There 's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of Queen of the Damned , as its origins in an Anne Rice novel dictate , but generally , it 's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance .
0 The only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers .
1 This one is certainly well-meaning , but it 's also simple-minded and contrived .
2 Coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else .
0 Bad and baffling from the get-go .
0 A series of immaculately composed shots of Patch Adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie .
0 At a time when we 've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , Collateral Damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture .
1 The impulses that produced this project ... are commendable , but the results are uneven .
1 A well-acted movie that simply does n't gel .
0 Like a can of 2-day old Coke .
0 You can taste it , but there 's no fizz .
0 There 's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish .
1 Both the crime story and the love story are unusual .
0 But they do n't fit well together and neither is well told .
0 It 's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant .
0 Other than a mildly engaging central romance , Hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst .
0 Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .
0 Outside of Burger 's desire to make some kind of film , it 's really unclear why this project was undertaken
1 Was I scared ?
1 Only at the prospect of Beck 's next project .
0 Let 's see , a haunted house , a haunted ship , what 's next ... Ghost Blimp ?
0 A fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming .
0 By the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around .
1 Since Lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random E !
1 True Hollywood Story .
0 Wes Craven 's presence is felt ; not the Craven of ' A Nightmare on Elm Street ' or ` The Hills Have Eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of ` Deadly Friend . '
1 Sunshine State surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology .
0 But the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed .
0 It 's one long bore .
0 It gets old quickly .
0 Watch Barbershop again if you 're in need of a Cube fix -- this is n't worth sitting through .
0 It 's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking .
0 ... a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it 's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone .
0 Skip this dreck , rent Animal House and go back to the source .
0 The movie is a desperate miscalculation .
0 It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time .
0 We just do n't really care too much about this love story .
0 In that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting .
0 The Transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull .
0 Uzumaki 's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse ...
1 ` Men in Black II creates a new threat for the MIB , but recycles the same premise .
2 Large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year 's radar screen that it 's tempting just to go with it for the ride .
0 But this time , the old MIB label stands for Milder Is n't Better .
0 Feels familiar and tired .
0 A retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese .
0 Instead of making his own style , director Marcus Adams just copies from various sources -- good sources , bad mixture
2 Criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes My Big Fat Greek Wedding look like an apartheid drama .
0 A bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points .
0 A story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material .
0 It 's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as The Country Bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at Disneyland .
0 Starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other Hollywood-action cliches .
0 Completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that I 'm not sure could be a single iota worse ... a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .
0 An uneven look into a grim future that does n't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on Philip K. Dick stories .
0 Horrible .
0 The disjointed mess flows as naturally as Jolie 's hideous yellow ` do .
2 Bolstered by an astonishing voice cast -LRB- excepting Love Hewitt -RRB- , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that I have n't encountered since at least Pete 's Dragon .
0 An authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium .
0 Makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases .
0 As the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , -LRB- Franco -RRB- has all of Dean 's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability .
0 The only thing to fear about `` Fear Dot Com '' is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film .
0 It 's too interested in jerking off in all its Byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .
0 ` Synthetic ' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree .
0 It concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between Chan and Hewitt .
0 Impostor ca n't think of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through dark tunnels , fight off various anonymous attackers , and evade elaborate surveillance technologies .
0 Judd 's characters ought to pick up the durable best seller Smart Women , Foolish Choices for advice .
0 The script has less spice than a rat burger and The Rock 's fighting skills are more in line with Steven Seagal .
0 This ill-conceived and expensive project winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it .
0 ... there 's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise .
0 Does n't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez .
0 A particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale .
0 It 's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of Janice Beard -LRB- Eileen Walsh -RRB- when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant .
0 ... it was n't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film ... It was the unfulfilling , incongruous , `` wait a second , did I miss something ? ''
1 ending .
0 This is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you 've been sitting still .
0 Poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action .
0 It 's super - violent , super-serious and super-stupid .
1 So earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script .
0 Just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite .
0 It 's Splash without the jokes .
0 The Château would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera .
1 Not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens .
0 Shallow , noisy and pretentious .
0 Morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he 's taken one of the world 's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating .
1 Granddad of Le Nouvelle Vague , Jean-Luc Godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek .
0 This loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience .
2 It 's better than The Phantom Menace .
0 But unless you 're an absolute raving Star Wars junkie , it is n't much fun .
0 Philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .
0 A standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for De Niro 's participation , would have likely wound up a TNT Original .
0 Coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , Circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story .
0 Hollywood Ending just is n't very funny .
0 Though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted .
0 A technical triumph and an extraordinary bore .
2 I can easily imagine Benigni 's Pinocchio becoming a Christmas perennial .
0 Coal is n't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children 's stockings .
0 Two hours of junk .
1 Ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and Joan 's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he 's a disloyal satyr .
1 Self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable .
0 A clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem .
0 The whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey ... -LRB- it -RRB- comes off like a Hallmark commercial .
0 What 's missing is what we call the ` wow ' factor .
0 The nicest thing that can be said about Stealing Harvard -LRB- which might have been called Freddy Gets Molested by a Dog -RRB- is that it 's not as obnoxious as Tom Green 's Freddie Got Fingered .
0 ... Tara Reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the Miss Hawaiian Tropic Pageant , so I do n't know what she 's doing in here ...
0 The young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient .
0 Normally , Rohmer 's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable .
1 I highly recommend Irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him .
0 It 's been 12 months and 295 preview screenings since I last walked out on a movie , but Resident Evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure .
0 This picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer .
1 Malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain .
0 But the movie 's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure .
2 Though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen The Hunger or Cat People will find little new here , but a tasty performance from Vincent Gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary .
0 A Blair Witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .
0 Diaz wears out her welcome in her most charmless performance
0 It is too bad that this likable movie is n't more accomplished .

0 The plot has a number of holes , and at times it 's simply baffling .
0 An ill-conceived jumble that 's not scary , not smart and not engaging .
0 Brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , Deuces Wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism .
0 Gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing .
1 `` What John does is heroic , but we do n't condone it , '' one of the film 's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture 's moral schizophrenia .
0 Like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you 've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably wo n't see the next six .
0 Its generic villains lack any intrigue -LRB- other than their funny accents -RRB- and the action scenes are poorly delivered .
0 Dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material .
0 Hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like ... but overall the Halloween series has lost its edge .
0 Stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed .
0 The story the movie tells is of Brian De Palma 's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career .
1 Too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could 've been an impacting film .
1 Generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it 's not without style .
0 With tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool .
0 It sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations .
0 Ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ?
0 Once Ice-T sticks his mug in the window of the couple 's BMW and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window .
1 The best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding .
0 Quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance .
0 It would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi .
1 In the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is .
0 For most movies , 82 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence .
1 While Glover , the irrepressible eccentric of River 's Edge , Dead Man and Back to the Future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents Bartleby 's main overall flaw .
0 Shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was .
0 Tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident .
2 As immaculate as Stuart Little 1 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous .
0 Simply a re-hash of the other seven films .
0 With jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , Yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is .
0 He fails .
1 I found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done .
0 A very depressing movie of many missed opportunities .
0 Goes on and on to the point of nausea .
0 By turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy .
0 Boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas .
0 One problem with the movie , directed by Joel Schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time .
0 The comedy is nonexistent .
0 ... a bland , pretentious mess .
0 It 's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out ` amateur ' in almost every frame .
0 A bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort .
0 It 's not just the vampires that are damned in Queen of the Damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate .
0 If religious films are n't your bailiwick , stay away .
0 Otherwise , this could be a passable date film .
0 This is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience .
1 The pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything .
0 Stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about .
0 It is most of the things Costner movies are known for ; it 's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it .
0 Do n't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that Hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action .
0 Chai 's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack .
0 To be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed .
0 The director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone .
1 One just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters .
0 Instead of panoramic sweep , Kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story 's emotional thrust .
0 The director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in -LRB- the characters ' -RRB- misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it .
0 This dubious product of a college-spawned -LRB- Colgate U. -RRB- comedy ensemble known as Broken Lizard plays like a mix of Cheech and Chong and CHiPs .
0 The movie does n't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us .
1 Super Troopers is an odd amalgam of comedy genres , existing somewhere between the often literal riffs of early Zucker Brothers\/Abrahams films , and the decidedly foul stylings of their post-modern contemporaries , The Farrelly Brothers .
1 ... will always be remembered for the 9-10 terrorist attacks .
0 After seeing the film , I can tell you that there 's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it .
1 Made me feel uneasy , even queasy , because -LRB- Solondz 's -RRB- cool compassion is on the border of bemused contempt .
2 As a kind of colorful , dramatized PBS program , Frida gets the job done .
1 But , for that , why not watch a documentary ?
0 With minimal imagination , you could restage the whole thing in your bathtub .
0 Nights feels more like a quickie TV special than a feature film ... It 's not even a TV special you 'd bother watching past the second commercial break .
0 Although ... visually striking and slickly staged , it 's also cold , grey , antiseptic and emotionally desiccated .
1 You can see where Big Bad Love is trying to go , but it never quite gets there .
0 Friday After Next is the kind of film that could only be made by African-Americans because of its broad racial insensitivity towards African-Americans .
0 It 's not as awful as some of the recent Hollywood trip tripe ... but it 's far from a groundbreaking endeavor .
0 The only thing `` swept away '' is the one hour and thirty-three minutes spent watching this waste of time .
0 One-sided documentary offers simplistic explanations to a very complex situation .
0 ... Stylistically , the movie is a disaster .
0 The corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption .
0 As violent , profane and exploitative as the most offensive action flick you 've ever seen .
1 Egoyan 's work often elegantly considers various levels of reality and uses shifting points of view , but here he has constructed a film so labyrinthine that it defeats his larger purpose .
1 Life or Something Like It has its share of high points , but it misses too many opportunities .
0 This is a truly , truly bad movie .

0 Believability was n't one of the film 's virtues .
0 Sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they 'd need a shower .

1 His best film remains his shortest , The Hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .
0 Just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller .
0 ... stumbles over every cheap trick in the book trying to make the outrage come even easier .
0 Even the hastily and amateurishly drawn animation can not engage .
0 Kung Pow is Oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
0 Busy urban comedy is clearly not Zhang 's forte , his directorial touch is neither light nor magical enough to bring off this kind of whimsy .
0 Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been ?
2 -- but certainly hard to hate .
0 A movie that ca n't get sufficient distance from Leroy 's delusions to escape their maudlin influence .
1 It 's Young Guns meets Goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs .
0 - greaseballs mob action-comedy .
0 Louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother Hoffman 's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just does n't make sense .
0 The movie straddles the fence between escapism and social commentary , and on both sides it falls short .
2 The film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface .
1 Ca n't get enough of libidinous young city dwellers ?
0 Try this obscenely bad dark comedy , so crass that it makes Edward Burns ' Sidewalks of New York look like Oscar Wilde .
0 In The New Guy , even the bull gets recycled .
1 Largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers .
0 On top of a foundering performance , -LRB- Madonna 's -RRB- denied her own athleticism by lighting that emphasizes every line and sag .
1 This is the first full scale WWII flick from Hong Kong 's John Woo .
0 He 's not good with people .
0 Patchy combination of soap opera , low-tech magic realism and , at times , ploddingly sociological commentary .
0 -LRB- Stevens is -RRB- so stoked to make an important film about human infidelity and happenstance that he tosses a kitchen sink onto a story already overladen with plot conceits .
0 So boring that even its target audience talked all the way through it .
0 One of the more glaring signs of this movie 's servitude to its superstar is the way it skirts around any scenes that might have required genuine acting from Ms. Spears .
0 Hollywood Ending is the most disappointing Woody Allen movie ever .
2 He has a great cast and a great idea .
1 But the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work .
1 ... generically , forgettably pleasant from start to finish .
0 It 's just hard to believe that a life like this can sound so dull .
0 When not wallowing in its characters ' frustrations , the movie is busy contriving false , sitcom-worthy solutions to their problems .
0 An overstylized , puréed mélange of sex , psychology , drugs and philosophy .
1 Sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery .
1 ` Lovely and Amazing , ' unhappily , is neither ... excessively strained and contrived .
0 Ringu is a disaster of a story , full of holes and completely lacking in chills .
0 Ignore the reputation , and ignore the film .
2 This one is a few bits funnier than Malle 's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like Slob City reductions of Damon Runyon crooks .
0 ` It 's painful to watch Witherspoon 's talents wasting away inside unnecessary films like Legally Blonde and Sweet Home Abomination , I mean , Alabama . '
0 A plodding teen remake that 's so mechanical you can smell the grease on the plot twists .
0 Trying to figure out the rules of the Country Bear universe -- when are bears bears and when are they like humans , only hairier -- would tax Einstein 's brain .
0 Even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash .
2 Amidst the action , the script carries Arnold -LRB- and the viewers -RRB- into the forbidden zone of sympathizing with terrorist motivations by presenting the `` other side of the story . ''
0 Rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue .
1 It 's a 100-year old mystery that is constantly being interrupted by Elizabeth Hurley in a bathing suit .
1 ... one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .
0 Too intensely focused on the travails of being Hal Hartley to function as pastiche , No Such Thing is Hartley 's least accessible screed yet .
1 Kenneth Branagh 's energetic sweet-and-sour performance as a curmudgeonly British playwright grounds this overstuffed , erratic dramedy in which he and his improbably forbearing wife contend with craziness and child-rearing in Los Angeles .
0 Director Uwe Boll and writer Robert Dean Klein fail to generate any interest in an unsympathetic hero caught up in an intricate plot that while cleverly worked out , can not overcome blah characters .
0 Ms. Phoenix is completely lacking in charm and charisma , and is unable to project either Esther 's initial anomie or her eventual awakening .
0 The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man .

0 The fetid underbelly of fame has never looked uglier .
0 A little weak -- and it is n't that funny .

1 They exist for hushed lines like `` They 're back ! ''
2 , `` They 're out there ! ''
1 and `` They 're coming ! ''
0 Elegantly crafted but emotionally cold , a puzzle whose intricate construction one can admire but is difficult to connect with on any deeper level .

1 It follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every Schwarzenegger film : Someone crosses Arnie .
1 Arnie blows things up .
1 Ice Age posits a heretofore unfathomable question : Is it possible for computer-generated characters to go through the motions ?
0 An incoherent jumble of a film that 's rarely as entertaining as it could have been .
1 ... they missed the boat .
0 More dutiful than enchanting ... terribly episodic and lacking the spark of imagination that might have made it an exhilarating treat .
0 Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .
0 The comedy Death to Smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
0 Barney 's ideas about creation and identity do n't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour 's worth of actual material .
1 Affleck merely creates an outline for a role he still needs to grow into , a role that Ford effortlessly filled with authority .
0 Cinematic pyrotechnics aside , the only thing Avary seems to care about are mean giggles and pulchritude .
1 It makes sense that he went back to school to check out the girls -- his film is a frat boy 's idea of a good time .
1 The narrative is so consistently unimaginative that probably the only way to have saved the film is with the aid of those wisecracking Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys .
0 Nothing more or less than an outright bodice-ripper -- it should have ditched the artsy pretensions and revelled in the entertaining shallows .
2 A living testament to the power of the eccentric and the strange .
0 The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .
0 Feels less like a cousin to Blade Runner than like a bottom-feeder sequel in the Escape From New York series .
0 What might have been acceptable on the printed page of Iles ' book does not translate well to the screen .
0 If Oscar had a category called Best Bad Film You Thought Was Going To Be Really Awful But Was n't , Guys would probably be duking it out with The Queen of the Damned for the honor .
0 A poky and pseudo-serious exercise in sham actor workshops and an affected malaise .
0 Mediocre fable from Burkina Faso .
2 Fessenden has nurtured his metaphors at the expense of his narrative , but he does display an original talent .
1 Since the movie is based on a Nicholas Sparks best seller , you know death is lurking around the corner , just waiting to spoil things .
0 Bottom-rung New Jack City wannabe .
0 Fincher takes no apparent joy in making movies , and he gives none to the audience .
0 It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .
2 Nicholas Nickleby celebrates the human spirit with such unrelenting Dickensian decency that it turned me -LRB- horrors ! -RRB-
1 into Scrooge .
0 Fear Dot Com is more frustrating than a modem that disconnects every 10 seconds .
0 Full of flatulence jokes and mild sexual references , Kung Pow !
0 is the kind of movie that 's critic-proof , simply because it aims so low .
0 May cause you to bite your tongue to keep from laughing at the ridiculous dialog or the oh-so convenient plot twists .
0 There are just too many characters saying too many clever things and getting into too many pointless situations .
0 Where 's the movie here ?
1 A dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires .
0 Lacking substance and soul , Crossroads comes up shorter than Britney 's cutoffs .
0 Cassavetes thinks he 's making Dog Day Afternoon with a cause , but all he 's done is to reduce everything he touches to a shrill , didactic cartoon .
0 Buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled Mr. Chips off the Old Block .
0 Although sensitive to a fault , it 's often overwritten , with a surfeit of weighty revelations , flowery dialogue , and nostalgia for the past and roads not taken .
0 It 's so badly made on every level that I 'm actually having a hard time believing people were paid to make it .
0 In the real world , an actor this uncharismatically beautiful would have a résumé loaded with credits like `` Girl in Bar # 2 . ''
0 ... although this idea is `` new '' the results are tired .
2 I 'm guessing the director is a magician .
0 After all , he took three minutes of dialogue , 30 seconds of plot and turned them into a 90-minute movie that feels five hours long .
0 An unencouraging threefold expansion on the former MTV series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc. .
0 In its own way , Joshua is as blasphemous and nonsensical as a Luis Buñuel film without the latter 's attendant intelligence , poetry , passion , and genius .
0 an appalling ` Ace Ventura ' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together Kevin Pollak , former wrestler Chyna and Dolly Parton .
0 If any of them list this ` credit ' on their resumes in the future , that 'll be much funnier than anything in the film ...
0 The only entertainment you 'll derive from this choppy and sloppy affair will be from unintentional giggles -- several of them .
0 Puportedly `` Based on True Events , '' a convolution of language that suggests it 's impossible to claim that it is `` Based on a True Story '' with a straight face .
0 ... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project !
2 Tambor and Clayburgh make an appealing couple -- he 's understated and sardonic , she 's appealingly manic and energetic .
0 Both deserve better .
0 -- that the ` true story ' by which All the Queen 's Men is allegedly `` inspired '' was a lot funnier and more deftly enacted than what 's been cobbled together onscreen .
0 Is there a group of more self-absorbed women than the mother and daughters featured in this film ?
0 I do n't think so .
0 Nothing wrong with performances here , but the whiney characters bugged me .
0 Not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .
0 Another week , another gross-out college comedy -- ugh .
0 A battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .
0 The movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical .
0 What 's worse is that Pelosi knows it .
0 ... instead go rent `` Shakes The Clown '' , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great Robin Williams performance .
0 If the title is a Jeopardy question , then the answer might be `` How does Steven Seagal come across these days ? ''
0 or maybe `` How will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of The Rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ? ''
0 The appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .
0 The story really has no place to go since Simone is not real -- she ca n't provide any conflict .
0 First-time director João Pedro Rodrigues ' unwillingness to define his hero 's background or motivations becomes more and more frustrating as the film goes on .
0 `` Interview '' loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a TV episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into .
0 ` Unfaithful ' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory .
0 Too bad .
0 Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents
0 Plays like one of those conversations that Comic Book Guy on `` The Simpsons '' has .
1 `` Juwanna Mann ? ''
0 No thanks .
0 Wewannour money back , actually .
1 Newcomer helmer Kevin Donovan is hamstrung by a badly handled screenplay of what is really an amusing concept -- a high-tech tux that transforms its wearer into a superman .
0 Should n't have been allowed to use the word `` new '' in its title , because there 's not an original character , siuation or joke in the entire movie .
0 Often silly -- and gross -- but it 's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films .
0 The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap .
0 Any rock pile will do for a set .
0 Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap .
1 Britney 's performance can not be faulted .
0 Lucy 's a dull girl , that 's all .
0 I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .
0 It 's a bad sign when you 're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects ' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it 's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .
0 Stephen Earnhart 's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition -- wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text -- when it 's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .
0 A semi-autobiographical film that 's so sloppily written and cast that you can not believe anyone more central to the creation of Bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it .
0 The movie barely makes sense , with its unbelievable naïveté and arbitrary flashbacks .
1 Pumpkin struts about with `` courage '' pinned to its huckster lapel while a yellow streak a mile wide decorates its back .
0 Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .
0 ... has about 3\/4th the fun of its spry 2000 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .
0 It 's tough to tell which is in more abundant supply in this woefully hackneyed movie , directed by Scott Kalvert , about street gangs and turf wars in 1958 Brooklyn -- stale cliches , gratuitous violence , or empty machismo .
0 Gooding and Coburn are both Oscar winners , a fact which , as you watch them clumsily mugging their way through Snow Dogs , seems inconceivable .
0 At every opportunity to do something clever , the film goes right over the edge and kills every sense of believability ... all you have left is a no-surprise series of explosions and violence while Banderas looks like he 's not trying to laugh at how bad it
0 ... pitiful , slapdash disaster .
0 A DOA dud from frame one .
0 Jaw-droppingly superficial , straining to get by on humor that is not even as daring as John Ritter 's glory days on Three 's Company .
2 There are plenty of scenes in Frida that do work , but rarely do they involve the title character herself .
0 Although God Is Great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling that it was intended to be a different kind of film .
1 The dark and bittersweet twist feels strange as things turn nasty and tragic during the final third of the film .
0 First-timer John McKay is never able to pull it back on course .
0 Distances you by throwing out so many red herrings , so many false scares , that the genuine ones barely register .
0 Godard uses his characters -- if that 's not too glorified a term -- as art things , mouthpieces , visual motifs , blanks .
0 The movie generates plot points with a degree of randomness usually achieved only by lottery drawing .
0 A predictable , manipulative stinker .
0 The story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .
1 Eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath .
2 It 's a spectacular performance - ahem , we hope it 's only acting .
0 The movie suffers from two fatal ailments -- a dearth of vitality and a story that 's shapeless and uninflected .
0 It 's just weirdness for the sake of weirdness , and where Human Nature should be ingratiating , it 's just grating .
2 An ambitiously naturalistic , albeit half-baked , drama about an abused , inner-city autistic teen .
0 once she lets her love depraved leads meet , -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- story becomes a hopeless , unsatisfying muddle
1 The dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically .
1 The people in ABC Africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras .
0 What 's really sad is to see two Academy Award winning actresses -LRB- and one Academy Award winning actor -RRB- succumb to appearing in this junk that 's TV sitcom material at best .
2 No doubt the star and everyone else involved had their hearts in the right place .
0 Where their heads were is anyone 's guess .
0 Call me a cynic , but there 's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message .
0 A gratingly unfunny groaner littered with zero-dimensional , unlikable characters and hackneyed , threadbare comic setups .
2 Got some good , organic character work , lots of obvious political insights and little room for engaging , imaginative filmmaking in its nearly 2 1\/1 - hour , dissipated length .
0 A painfully slow cliche-ridden film filled with more holes than Clyde Barrow 's car .
0 Like leafing through an album of photos accompanied by the sketchiest of captions .
0 I guess it just goes to show that if you give a filmmaker an unlimited amount of phony blood , nothing good can happen .
0 Gaghan captures the half-lit , sometimes creepy intimacy of college dorm rooms , a subtlety that makes the silly , over-the-top coda especially disappointing .
0 Feels less like a change in -LRB- Herzog 's -RRB- personal policy than a half-hearted fluke .
0 One of the most unpleasant things the studio has ever produced .
0 Will anyone who is n't a Fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n't gone straight to video ?
0 A selection of scenes in search of a movie .
0 -LRB- Janey -RRB- forgets about her other obligations , leading to a tragedy which is somehow guessable from the first few minutes , maybe because it echoes the by now intolerable morbidity of so many recent movies .
0 Will undoubtedly play well in European markets , where Mr. Besson is a brand name , and in Asia , where Ms. Shu is an institution , but American audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .
0 True to its animatronic roots : ... as stiff , ponderous and charmless as a mechanical apparatus ... ` The Country Bears ' should never have been brought out of hibernation .
0 -LRB- Evans is -RRB- a fascinating character , and deserves a better vehicle than this facetious smirk of a movie .
0 The script 's judgment and sense of weight is way , way off .
1 You come away wishing , though , that the movie spent a lot less time trying to make a credible case for reports from the afterlife and a lot more time on the romantic urgency that 's at the center of the story .
0 Evelyn may be based on a true and historically significant story , but the filmmakers have made every effort to disguise it as an unimaginative screenwriter 's invention .
0 A derivative collection of horror and sci-fi cliches .
0 Loosely speaking , we 're in All of Me territory again , and , strictly speaking , Schneider is no Steve Martin .
0 As aimless as an old pickup skidding completely out of control on a long patch of black ice , the movie makes two hours feel like four .
0 Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .
0 Just the sort of lazy tearjerker that gives movies about ordinary folk a bad name .
0 The redeeming feature of Chan 's films has always been the action , but the stunts in The Tuxedo seem tired and , what 's worse , routine .
0 While The Importance of Being Earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n't give us a reason to be in the theater beyond Wilde 's wit and the actors ' performances .
0 Has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool .
0 A rambling ensemble piece with loosely connected characters and plots that never quite gel .
1 A Lifetime movie about men .
1 The Balkans provide the obstacle course for the love of a good woman .
0 It 's hard to say who might enjoy this , are there Tolstoy groupies out there ?
1 It 's dark and tragic , and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death
0 This is a movie that starts out like Heathers , then becomes Bring it On , then becomes unwatchable .
0 The screenplay flounders under the weight of too many story lines .
0 I think it was Plato who said , ' I think , therefore I know better than to rush to the theatre for this one . '
0 If Damon and Affleck attempt another Project Greenlight , next time out they might try paying less attention to the miniseries and more attention to the film it is about .
0 This is rote drivel aimed at Mom and Dad 's wallet .
0 Contrived , maudlin and cliche-ridden ... if this sappy script was the best the contest received , those rejected must have been astronomically bad .
0 I hate the feeling of having been slimed in the name of High Art .
1 This is more a case of ` Sacre bleu ! '
1 than ` Magnifique ' .
0 The kids in the audience at the preview screening seemed bored , cheering the pratfalls but little else ; their parents , wise folks that they are , read books .
0 Whether Jason X is this bad on purpose is never clear .
0 But one thing 's for sure : It never comes close to being either funny or scary .
1 Yet another weepy Southern bore-athon .
2 I like all four of the lead actors a lot and they manage to squeeze a few laughs out of the material , but they 're treading water at best in this forgettable effort .
1 Perhaps the most annoying thing about Who Is Cletis Tout ?
0 is that it 's a crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime .
1 Except as an acting exercise or an exceptionally dark joke , you wonder what anyone saw in this film that allowed it to get made .
0 This insufferable movie is meant to make you think about existential suffering .
0 Instead , it 'll only put you to sleep .
1 Who is this movie for ?
1 Not kids , who do n't need the lesson in repugnance .
0 It 's also not smart or barbed enough for older viewers -- not everyone thinks poo-poo jokes are ` edgy . '
0 A sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices .
0 It 's so tedious that it makes you forgive every fake , dishonest , entertaining and , ultimately , more perceptive moment in Bridget Jones 's Diary .
0 Almost as offensive as `` Freddy Got Fingered . ''
0 The gifted Crudup has the perfect face to play a handsome blank yearning to find himself , and his cipherlike personality and bad behavior would play fine if the movie knew what to do with him .
0 It is depressing , ruthlessly pained and depraved , the movie equivalent of staring into an open wound .
0 Ponderous , plodding soap opera disguised as a feature film .
0 Cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .
0 For the future , one hopes Mr. Plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter .
0 A cheap scam put together by some cynical creeps at Revolution Studios and Imagine Entertainment to make the suckers out there surrender $ 9 and 92 minutes of unrecoverable life .
0 Reign of Fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness .
2 Human Nature is a goofball movie , in the way that Malkovich was , but it tries too hard .
0 Originality is sorely lacking .
1 The plot 's clearly mythic structure may owe more to Disney 's strong sense of formula than to the original story .
2 But while the highly predictable narrative falls short , Treasure Planet is truly gorgeous to behold .
0 Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .
1 Ram Dass Fierce Grace moulds itself as an example to up-and-coming documentarians , of the overlooked pitfalls of such an endeavour .
1 Lucky Break is perfectly inoffensive and harmless , but it 's also drab and inert .
0 For a story set at sea , Ghost Ship is pretty landbound , with its leaden acting , dull exposition and telegraphed ` surprises . '
0 There might be some sort of credible gender-provoking philosophy submerged here , but who the hell cares ?
0 Nothing more than a stifling morality tale dressed up in peekaboo clothing .
0 I like my Christmas movies with more elves and snow and less pimps and ho 's .
0 It all seemed wasted like DeNiro 's once promising career and the once grand Long Beach boardwalk .
0 -LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .
0 Unfortunately , a cast of competent performers from movies , television and the theater are cast adrift in various New York City locations with no unifying rhythm or visual style .
1 Just entertaining enough not to hate , too mediocre to love .
1 ` Sophisticated ' viewers who refuse to admit that they do n't like it will likely call it ` challenging ' to their fellow sophisticates .
0 Equilibrium the movie , as opposed to the manifesto , is really , really stupid .
0 Excruciatingly unfunny and pitifully unromantic .
0 The film 's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes ... drag the movie down .
0 It does n't offer audiences any way of gripping what its point is , or even its attitude toward its subject .
0 This kiddie-oriented stinker is so bad that I even caught the gum stuck under my seat trying to sneak out of the theater
0 Though Impostor deviously adopts the guise of a modern motion picture , it too is a bomb .
0 Cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of Nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .
0 Every note rings false .
0 When the screenwriter responsible for one of the worst movies of one year directs an equally miserable film the following year , you 'd have a hard time believing it was just coincidence .
0 It never rises to its clever what-if concept .
1 Admirably ambitious but self-indulgent .
0 This story of unrequited love does n't sustain interest beyond the first half-hour .
0 This angst-ridden territory was covered earlier and much better in Ordinary People .
0 The entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another .
0 About half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal .
0 A big , loud , bang-the-drum bore .
0 -LRB- Less a movie than -RRB- an appalling , odoriferous thing ... so rotten in almost every single facet of production that you 'll want to crawl up your own \*\*\* in embarrassment .
2 The concept behind Kung Pow : Enter the Fist is hilarious .
1 It 's too bad nothing else is .
1 Hardman is a grating , mannered onscreen presence , which is especially unfortunate in light of the fine work done by most of the rest of her cast .
0 El Crimen Del Padre Amaro would likely be most effective if used as a tool to rally anti-Catholic protestors .
2 Interesting and thoroughly unfaithful version of Carmen
2 A serious movie with serious ideas .
0 But seriously , folks , it does n't work .
0 There 's nothing exactly wrong here , but there 's not nearly enough that 's right .
0 The action here is unusually tame , the characters are too simplistic to maintain interest , and the plot offers few surprises .
0 I could n't help but feel the wasted potential of this slapstick comedy .
0 What Madonna does here ca n't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it 's moving and it 's talking and it 's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .
0 -LRB- A -RRB- painfully flat gross-out comedy ...
0 Even if you 're an Elvis person , you wo n't find anything to get excited about on this DVD .
1 The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .
0 It 's bedeviled by labored writing and slack direction .
0 I 'm sure there 's a teenage boy out there somewhere who 's dying for this kind of entertainment .
0 The Tuxedo miscalculates badly by forcing the star to play second fiddle to the dull effects that allow the suit to come to life .
0 The film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama .
0 Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .
0 There 's a little violence and lots of sex in a bid to hold our attention , but it grows monotonous after a while , as do Joan and Philip 's repetitive arguments , schemes and treachery .
0 It drowns in sap .
2 Deliberately and devotedly constructed , Far from Heaven is too picture postcard perfect , too neat and new pin-like , too obviously a recreation to resonate .
0 It 's rare that a movie can be as intelligent as this one is in every regard except its storyline ; everything that 's good is ultimately scuttled by a plot that 's just too boring and obvious .
0 I 'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment .
0 There 's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease .
1 The good thing -- the only good thing -- about Extreme Ops is that it 's so inane that it gave me plenty of time to ponder my Thanksgiving to-do list .
0 The modern-day characters are nowhere near as vivid as the 19th-century ones .
2 Blessed with a searing lead performance by Ryan Gosling -LRB- Murder by Numbers -RRB- , the movie is powerful and provocative .
0 It 's also built on a faulty premise , one it follows into melodrama and silliness .
0 Uneven performances and a spotty script add up to a biting satire that has no teeth .
0 Director Jay Russell stomps in hobnail boots over Natalie Babbitt 's gentle , endearing 1975 children 's novel .
1 Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .
0 The troubling thing about Clockstoppers is that it does n't make any sense .
0 With its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it 's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés .
1 Mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic : two parts exhausting Men in Black mayhem to one part family values .
0 Kicks off with an inauspicious premise , mopes through a dreary tract of virtually plotless meanderings and then ends with a whimper .
0 A rote exercise in both animation and storytelling .
0 The material and the production itself are little more than routine .
0 The movie 's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it 's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had .
0 Not even Steven Spielberg has dreamed up such blatant and sickening product placement in a movie .
0 It 's all surface psychodramatics .
0 The Mothman Prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .
0 That frenetic spectacle -LRB- on the TV show -RRB- has usually been leavened by a charm that 's conspicuously missing from the Girls ' big-screen blowout .
0 Kitschy , flashy , overlong soap opera .
0 For all the time we spend with these people , we never really get inside of them .
0 Yet another Arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents .
0 Sandra Bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff .
0 An undistinguished attempt to make a classic theater piece cinematic .
0 too many scenarios in which the hero might have an opportunity to triumphantly sermonize , and too few that allow us to wonder for ourselves if things will turn out okay .
0 There is simply not enough of interest onscreen to sustain its seventy-minute running time .
1 A wordy wisp of a comedy .
0 Broomfield 's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient .
0 -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .
0 Has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together TV episodes .
0 A series of escapades demonstrating the adage that what is good for the goose is also good for the gander , some of which occasionally amuses but none of which amounts to much of a story .
0 Ozpetek offers an AIDS subtext , skims over the realities of gay sex , and presents yet another tired old vision of the gay community as an all-inclusive world where uptight , middle class bores like Antonia can feel good about themselves .
1 A dopey movie clothed in excess layers of hipness .
0 The Sweetest Thing is expressly for idiots who do n't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance .
0 Sinks so low in a poorly played game of absurd plot twists , idiotic court maneuvers and stupid characters that even Freeman ca n't save it .
1 I realized that no matter how fantastic Reign of Fire looked , its story was making no sense at all .
0 It made me realize that we really have n't had a good cheesy B-movie playing in theaters since ... well ... since last week 's Reign of Fire .
0 Some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever , were made for the palm screen .
0 SC1 is an autopilot Hollywood concoction lacking in imagination and authentic Christmas spirit , yet it 's geared toward an audience full of masters of both .
1 After all the big build-up , the payoff for the audience , as well as the characters , is messy , murky , unsatisfying .
0 Seems content to dog-paddle in the mediocre end of the pool , and it 's a sad , sick sight .
2 It 's refreshing that someone understands the need for the bad boy ; Diesel , with his brawny frame and cool , composed delivery , fits the bill perfectly .
1 If all of Eight Legged Freaks was as entertaining as the final hour , I would have no problem giving it an unqualified recommendation .
0 Suffers from a flat script and a low budget .
2 There are deeply religious and spiritual people in this world who would argue that entering a church , synagogue or temple does n't mean you have to check your brain at the door .
1 The same should go for movie theaters .
0 Seemingly a vehicle to showcase the Canadian 's inane ramblings , Stealing Harvard is a smorgasbord of soliloquies about nothing delivered by the former Mr. Drew Barrymore .
1 The film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film .
1 As it stands it 's an opera movie for the buffs .
0 This franchise has not spawned a single good film .
0 The crap continues .
0 Its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who has n't been living under a rock -LRB- since Sept. 10 -RRB- .
2 High drama , Disney-style - a wing and a prayer and a hunky has-been pursuing his castle in the sky .
0 Like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through , the characters in Swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .
0 One big blustery movie where nothing really happens .
0 When it comes out on video , then it 's the perfect cure for insomnia .
0 Like a comedian who starts off promisingly but then proceeds to flop , Comedian runs out of steam after a half hour .
0 The pairing does sound promising in theory ... but their lack of chemistry makes Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro in Showtime look like old , familiar vaudeville partners .
1 Director Chris Eyre is going through the paces again with his usual high melodramatic style of filmmaking .
1 As it stands , there 's some fine sex onscreen , and some tense arguing , but not a whole lot more .
0 I could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` Tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay .
1 The picture does n't know it 's a comedy .
0 A stupid , derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense .
0 The rollerball sequences feel sanitised and stagey .
0 Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion .
1 Nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .

2 Writer\/director Burr Steers emphasizes the Q in Quirky , with mixed results .
0 One senses in World Traveler and in his earlier film that Freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .
2 In between the icy stunts , the actors spout hilarious dialogue about following your dream and ` just letting the mountain tell you what to do . '
1 The obligatory break-ups and hook-ups do n't seem to have much emotional impact on the characters .

0 For the rest of us , sitting through Dahmer 's two hours amounts to little more than punishment .
1 Narc can only remind us of brilliant crime dramas without becoming one itself .
0 Somewhere inside the mess that is World Traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out .
1 A tedious parable about honesty and good sportsmanship .
1 Its strengths and weaknesses play off each other virtually to a stand-off , with the unfortunate trump card being the dreary mid-section of the film .
0 An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .
0 The movie 's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director Michel Gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness .
1 A glossy knock-off of a B-movie revenge flick .
0 ... expands the horizons of boredom to the point of collapse , turning into a black hole of dullness , from which no interesting concept can escape .
1 It 's just plain boring .
0 Sad nonsense , this .
2 But not without cheesy fun factor .
0 One of those decades-spanning historical epics that strives to be intimate and socially encompassing but fails to do justice to either effort in three hours of screen time .
1 Really dumb but occasionally really funny .
0 The movie wavers between Hallmark card sentimentality and goofy , life-affirming moments straight out of a cellular phone commercial .
0 The director 's many dodges and turns add up to little more than a screenful of gamesmanship that 's low on both suspense and payoff .
0 While the transgressive trappings -LRB- especially the frank sex scenes -RRB- ensure that the film is never dull , Rodrigues 's beast-within metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought , making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative .
0 The satire is unfocused , while the story goes nowhere .
0 They threw loads of money at an idea that should 've been so much more even if it was only made for teenage boys and wrestling fans .
0 It 's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of Action Man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of -LRB- Woo 's -RRB- best work .
0 Reyes ' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it 's undone by a sloppy script
0 If you 're over 25 , have an IQ over 90 , and have a driver 's license , you should be able to find better entertainment .
0 The darker elements of misogyny and unprovoked violence suffocate the illumination created by the two daughters and the sparse instances of humor meant to shine through the gloomy film noir veil .
1 ... the picture 's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .
0 Never does `` Lilo & Stitch '' reach the emotion or timelessness of Disney 's great past , or even that of more recent successes such as `` Mulan '' or `` Tarzan . ''
0 One of those so-so films that could have been much better .
0 Crossroads feels like a teenybopper Ed Wood film , replete with the pubescent scandalous innuendo and the high-strung but flaccid drama .
0 Fails to satisfactorily exploit its gender politics , genre thrills or inherent humor .
0 Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .
0 Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .
0 It has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline .
0 It appears to have been made by people to whom the idea of narrative logic or cohesion is an entirely foreign concept .
1 Less a heartfelt appeal for the handicapped than a nice Belgian waffle .
0 It 's not helpful to listen to extremist name-calling , regardless of whether you think Kissinger was a calculating fiend or just a slippery self-promoter .
0 Abandon spends 90 minutes trying figure out whether or not some cocky pseudo-intellectual kid has intentionally left college or was killed .
0 The only problem is that , by the end , no one in the audience or the film seems to really care .
2 No Such Thing is sort of a minimalist Beauty and the Beast , but in this case the Beast should definitely get top billing .
2 Robert John Burke as The Monster horns in and steals the show .
0 Due to stodgy , soap opera-ish dialogue , the rest of the cast comes across as stick figures reading lines from a TelePrompTer .
0 -LRB- T -RRB- he film is never sure to make a clear point -- even if it seeks to rely on an ambiguous presentation .
2 While it may not add up to the sum of its parts , Holofcener 's film offers just enough insight to keep it from being simpleminded , and the ensemble cast is engaging enough to keep you from shifting in your chair too often .
1 An overwrought Taiwanese soaper about three people and their mixed-up relationship .
0 Nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release .
0 A thoroughly awful movie -- dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy ... a weird amalgam of ` The Thing ' and a geriatric ` Scream . '
0 ... another example of how Sandler is losing his touch .
0 Nothing sticks , really , except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad , sordid universe of guns , drugs , avarice and damaged dreams .
0 What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .
0 The plot 's contrivances are uncomfortably strained .
0 Guilty of the worst sin of attributable to a movie like this : it 's not scary in the slightest .
0 Schnieder bounces around with limp wrists , wearing tight tummy tops and hip huggers , twirling his hair on his finger and assuming that 's enough to sustain laughs ...
0 Its simplicity puts an exclamation point on the fact that this is n't something to be taken seriously , but it also wrecks any chance of the movie rising above similar fare .
0 By the final whistle you 're convinced that this Mean Machine was a decent TV outing that just does n't have big screen magic .
0 To say that this vapid vehicle is downright doltish and uneventful is just as obvious as telling a country skunk that he has severe body odor .
0 A film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun .
0 Pretend it 's a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away .
2 It 's fun , but it 's a real howler .
0 Some fine acting , but ultimately a movie with no reason for being .
0 It 's difficult to feel anything much while watching this movie , beyond mild disturbance or detached pleasure at the acting .
0 A waterlogged version of ` Fatal Attraction ' for the teeny-bopper set ... a sad , soggy potboiler that wastes the talents of its attractive young leads .
1 It tells its story in a flat manner and leaves you with the impression that you should have gotten more out of it than you did .
0 Sweet gentle Jesus , did the screenwriters just do a cut-and-paste of every bad action-movie line in history ?
1 It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .
0 This is for the most part a useless movie , even with a great director at the helm .
0 A loud , witless mess that has none of the charm and little of the intrigue from the TV series .
0 Even on its own ludicrous terms , The Sum of All Fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the Ryan series .
1 Though it inspires some -LRB- out-of-field -RRB- creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .
0 As predictable as the outcome of a Globetrotters-Generals game , Juwanna Mann is even more ludicrous than you 'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .
1 Sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist Japanese jokes .
0 Where Tom Green stages his gags as assaults on America 's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , Jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .
1 More of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .
0 The April 2001 instalment of the American War for Independence , complete with loads of CGI and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .
0 Contains all the substance of a Twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .
0 Return to Neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill Disney sequel intended for the home video market .
0 Rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .
0 It 's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .
1 On a certain base level , Blue Crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .
0 The colorful Masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of Ganesh 's rise up the social ladder .
0 ... an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .
0 Wimps out by going for that PG-12 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .
2 Trapped presents a frightening and compelling ` What if ? '
1 scenario that will give most parents pause ... Then , something terrible happens .
0 Madonna has made herself over so often now , there 's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like Michael Jackson 's nose .
0 Never having seen the first two films in the series , I ca n't compare Friday After Next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .
0 The story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .
0 A depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .
0 It 's a bad action movie because there 's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .
0 -LRB- Soderbergh -RRB- tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience 's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .
1 Handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .
0 So aggressively cheery that Pollyana would reach for a barf bag .
0 Scooby-Doo does n't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , Nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .
0 Russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of Sommers 's title-bout features .
0 Highly uneven and inconsistent ... Margarita Happy Hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .
0 Very stupid and annoying .
0 The Sum of All Fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it 's really nothing more than warmed-over Cold War paranoia .
0 A listless and desultory affair .
0 Represents the depths to which the girls-behaving-badly film has fallen .
0 How inept is Serving Sara ?
0 It makes even Elizabeth Hurley seem graceless and ugly .
1 Jam-packed with literally bruising jokes .
1 Every five minutes or so , someone gets clocked .
1 Wins my vote for ` The 2001 Enemy of Cinema ' Award .
1 Any Chekhov is better than no Chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years .
0 Helmer Hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .
0 Lazy , miserable and smug .
0 This is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .
1 Formula 50 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market .
0 Every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable .
0 There 's no energy .
1 Apparently writer-director Attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .
1 After the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .
0 This is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like Them !
0 At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .
1 A bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .
1 A crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright Craig Lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his Prelude to a Kiss .
1 The film 's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .
0 If you recognize Zeus -LRB- the dog from Snatch -RRB- it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .
0 This is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , ` Ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '
1 Shanghai Ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .
1 Plays like a checklist of everything Rob Reiner and his cast were sending up .
0 There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .
2 It 's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .
0 All the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .
0 A cross between Blow and Boyz N The Hood , this movie strives to be more , but does n't quite get there .
2 Good performances keep it from being a total rehash .
0 The screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .
1 Troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .
2 At times , the movie looks genuinely pretty .
1 Your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but .
0 Not even Felinni would know what to make of this Italian freakshow .
1 Elmo touts his drug as being 50 times stronger than coke .
1 If you 're looking for a tale of Brits behaving badly , watch Snatch again .
1 It 's 50 times better than this .
0 It 's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in Slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .
0 Despite its promising cast of characters , Big Trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that ` zany ' does n't necessarily mean ` funny . '
0 Both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .
0 Does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .
0 Neither revelatory nor truly edgy -- merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .
0 Just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting .
1 There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .
0 Fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .
0 There 's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film 's simple title .
1 While Howard 's appreciation of Brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .
0 A preposterous , prurient whodunit .
0 Go , girls , right down the reality drain .
0 Boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , Impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .
0 Can be classified as one of those ` alternate reality ' movies ... except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .
2 Predictable and cloying , though Brown Sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .
0 ... unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .
0 The film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .
0 An imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .
0 Muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for Kevin Costner .
0 Too clumsy in key moments ... to make a big splash .
0 Just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that 's neither original nor terribly funny .
0 ` Matrix ' - style massacres erupt throughout ... but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with Kafka-inspired philosophy .
2 At least it 's a fairly impressive debut from the director , Charles Stone III .
0 It all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .
1 Wanker Goths are on the loose !
0 Run for your lives !
0 Why would anyone cast the magnificent Jackie Chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?
0 A grating , emaciated flick .
0 Unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .
1 Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .
0 We have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .
2 According to the script , Grant and Bullock 's characters are made for each other .
1 But you 'd never guess that from the performances .
1 The animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from Bambi and The Lion King , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .
0 Ararat feels like a book report
0 Steve Oedekerk is , alas , no Woody Allen .
0 A lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .
1 An amalgam of The Fugitive , Blade Runner , and Total Recall , only without much energy or tension .
0 The acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
0 Shows that Jackie Chan is getting older , and that 's something I would rather live in denial about
1 With miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , Killing Me Softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it 's - good camp .
1 Alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .
0 The slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .
0 This is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .
0 The problem with the mayhem in Formula 50 is not that it 's offensive , but that it 's boring .
0 Much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .
0 the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale
1 Mark Wahlberg ... may look classy in a '60s - homage pokepie hat , but as a character he 's dry , dry , dry .
0 Told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .
2 The irony is that this film 's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .
1 Now I can see why people thought I was too hard on `` The Mothman Prophecies '' .
2 If ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it .
0 If ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .
2 With an unusual protagonist -LRB- a kilt-wearing Jackson -RRB- and subject matter , the improbable `` Formula 50 '' is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .
1 Sandra Bullock 's best dramatic performance to date -LRB- is -RRB- almost enough to lift -LRB- this -RRB- thrill-kill cat-and-mouser ... above its paint-by-numbers plot .
0 A feel-good movie that does n't give you enough to feel good about .
2 Adolescents will be adequately served by the movie 's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a ` topless tutorial service . '
0 This mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .
0 The picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .
1 De Niro cries .
0 You 'll cry for your money back .
0 Slap me , I saw this movie .
0 -LRB- The kid 's -RRB- just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .
0 Behind the glitz , Hollywood is sordid and disgusting .
1 Quelle surprise !
0 Scherfig , who has had a successful career in TV , tackles more than she can handle .
0 Just consider what New Best Friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .
0 Oscar caliber cast does n't live up to material
1 The problems of the people in Love in the Time of Money are hardly specific to their era .
0 They just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .
0 Carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , Chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , ` If I stay positive , maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures , Drunken Master . '
0 So putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .
0 In the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about Kennedy 's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .
0 Starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .
0 Sometimes makes less sense than the Bruckheimeresque American action flicks it emulates .
0 One of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .
0 There 's only one way to kill Michael Myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .
1 ` Rare Birds ' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .
0 The movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .
1 Resident Evil is what comes from taking John Carpenter 's Ghosts of Mars and eliminating the beheadings .
0 In other words , about as bad a film you 're likely to see all year .
0 Five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .
0 The whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of Bewitched that takes place during Spring Break .
0 Well made but uninvolving , Bloodwork is n't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .
0 So we got Ten Little Indians meets Friday the 13th by way of Clean and Sober , filmed on the set of Carpenter 's The Thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of The Love Boat .
0 The movie 's blatant derivativeness is one reason it 's so lackluster .
0 Kids do n't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there 's lots of cute animals and clumsy people .
1 ` Snow Dogs ' has both .
1 It 's almost as if it 's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .
1 Wobbly Senegalese updating of `` Carmen '' which is best for the stunning star turn by Djeinaba Diop Gai
0 It 's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who does n't think about percentages all day long .
2 Ken Russell would love this .
0 In one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of Quentin Tarantino 's climactic shootout -- and Meat Loaf explodes .
1 Bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies .
0 This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .
0 The premise of `` Abandon '' holds promise , ... but its delivery is a complete mess .
1 What could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .
0 A little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , Monsoon Wedding serves mostly to whet one 's appetite for the Bollywood films .
0 Unless Bob Crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film 's impressive performances and adept direction are n't likely to leave a lasting impression .
1 The Rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer CGI effects .
2 The bottom line with Nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : Fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted need n't waste their time on it .
0 The lousy John Q all but spits out Denzel Washington 's fine performance in the title role .
0 The whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .
0 What a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !
0 The film is so packed with subplots involving the various Silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature film .
0 Opera on film is never satisfactory .
2 The art demands live viewing .
0 The innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .
0 Despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .
0 It is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
0 The Sweetest Thing leaves an awful sour taste .
0 It 's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .
0 Terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing ... The movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .
2 As dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost Shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .
0 Aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .
0 A low-rent retread of the Alien pictures .
1 Serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .
0 Its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .
0 A big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .
0 The story has little wit and no surprises .
0 The Merchant-Ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it 's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .
0 What should have been a cutting Hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week 's issue of Variety .
0 Hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children 's party clown gets violently gang-raped ?
1 I did n't think so .
0 A little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .
0 -LRB- T -RRB- his slop does n't even have potential as a cult film , as it 's too loud to shout insults at the screen .
0 The movie 's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .
0 ... may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence .
1 This Scarlet 's letter is A. . .
0 as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .
0 Plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .
1 The central character is n't complex enough to hold our interest .
1 A modestly comic , modestly action-oriented World War II adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .
0 A puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .
0 Just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making Ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .
0 A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .
0 There 's a heavy stench of ` been there , done that ' hanging over the film .
1 It 's everything you 'd expect -- but nothing more .
0 The biggest problem with Satin Rouge is Lilia herself .
1 She 's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but does n't reveal an inner life .
2 A quaint , romanticized rendering .
1 What with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake Love Liza for an Adam Sandler Chanukah song .
1 The movie 's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .
0 A potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .
0 Woody Allen used to ridicule movies like Hollywood Ending .
1 Now he makes them .
1 She 's not yet an actress , not quite a singer ...
1 Not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .
0 Been there done that .
0 There is only so much baked cardboard I need to chew .
0 A movie like The Guys is why film criticism can be considered work .
1 Schnitzler 's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .
0 Even if it made its original release date last fall , it would 've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .
1 Only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .
0 A loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .
0 A movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture .
0 We can tell what it is supposed to be , but ca n't really call it a work of art .
1 It 's a brilliant , honest performance by Nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic Kathy Bates turns up .
2 Bravado Kathy !
0 ... Liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character 's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario .
0 Too bad .
1 You can thank me for this .
1 I saw Juwanna Mann so you do n't have to .
0 Unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the Reginald Hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .
1 Basically , it 's pretty but dumb .
0 This romantic\/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .
0 Squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , Burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .
1 There 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but Kang tacks on three or four more endings .
1 Reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while Said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition .
0 It has no affect on the Kurds , but it wore me down .
0 The actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .
0 Co-writer\/director Jonathan Parker 's attempts to fashion a Brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .
1 If this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .
0 A superfluous sequel ... plagued by that old familiar feeling of ` let 's get this thing over with ' : Everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .
0 If there 's a heaven for bad movies , Deuces Wild is on its way .
0 Comes off like a bad imitation of the Bard .
0 What 's missing in Murder by Numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens ' deviant behaviour .
1 Being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .
0 An uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .
0 Horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it is n't incomprehensible .
0 A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm -LRB- wo n't be an -RRB- exceedingly memorable one for most people .
1 Slackers ' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film 's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .
0 If Festival in Cannes nails hard - boiled Hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .
0 The movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .
0 I have n't seen such self-amused trash since Freddy Got Fingered .
0 Little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
0 Rob Schneider 's infantile cross-dressing routines fill The Hot Chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .
0 A horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .
0 The film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .
0 The film is so bad it does n't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .
0 Sheridan 's take on the author 's schoolboy memoir ... is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .
0 It jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier .
1 How I Killed My Father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you 're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .
0 When it comes to the battle of Hollywood vs. Woo , it looks like Woo 's a P.O.W.
1 There are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .
0 The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .
0 It 's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .
2 The mushy finale turns John Q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .
0 Content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .
0 The movie turns out to be -LRB- Assayas ' -RRB- homage to the Gallic ` tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .
0 Its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like Prophet Jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .
0 -LRB- Seems -RRB- even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .
0 It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .
0 Neither as scary-funny as Tremors nor demented-funny as Starship Troopers , the movie is n't tough to take as long as you 've paid a matinee price .
0 If swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
1 What might 've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .
0 The Master of Disguise may have made a great Saturday Night Live sketch , but a great movie it is not .
0 It 's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the Cannes Film Festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .
0 Boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .
0 It 's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic .
0 Unfortunately , that 's precisely what Arthur Dong 's Family Fundamentals does .
1 Has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it 's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .
0 Like a medium-grade network sitcom -- mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .
0 Something must have been lost in the translation .
0 Becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any Plympton film : boring .
0 In the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we 're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .
0 Chan 's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there 's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .
0 Rock 's stand-up magic wanes .
2 Hopkins , squarely fills the screen .
0 Action - mechanical .
1 `` The Tuxedo '' should have been the vehicle for Chan that `` The Mask '' was for Jim Carrey .
2 Alas , it 's the man that makes the clothes .
0 For casual moviegoers who stumble into Rules expecting a slice of American Pie hijinks starring the kid from Dawson 's Creek , they 'll probably run out screaming .
0 The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .
1 What puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in Britney Spears ' first movie .
0 Plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing The Scorpion King .
2 City by the Sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for .
0 But how it washed out despite all of that is the project 's prime mystery .
0 Whatever the movie 's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet T-shirt and shower scenes .
1 As a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , Murder by Numbers fits the profile too closely .
1 There ai n't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it 's hilarious .
2 I enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .
0 What a pity ... that the material is so second-rate .
0 Does n't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past Seagal films .
0 The kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .
2 Nicks refuses to let Slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .
0 Nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of Elizabeth Hurley 's breasts -- is authentic .
1 Amid the cliché and foreshadowing , Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn .
0 Mostly , Shafer and co-writer Gregory Hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .
0 No cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces Wild .
0 Eddie Murphy and Owen Wilson have a cute partnership in I Spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm does n't do a load of good .
0 Strictly a ` guy 's film ' in the worst sense of the expression .
0 There 's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .
0 It 's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as Phoenix 's .
0 There 's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids ' movie ... that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where Santa gives gifts to grownups .
0 We 're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .
0 Like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories .
0 There is nothing redeeming about this movie .
0 The film has -LRB- its -RRB- moments , but they are few and far between .
0 I was trying to decide what annoyed me most about God is Great ... I 'm Not , and then I realized that I just did n't care .
0 Derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone .
1 Deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits .
0 ... comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .
0 Brosnan 's finest non-Bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film 's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes .
2 A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .
0 To me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy .
1 Tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often .
0 Flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they ca n't distract from the flawed support structure holding Equilibrium up .
0 ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .
0 How can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ?
0 In truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick -LRB- but none of the sheer lust -RRB- .
0 Nicks and Steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that 's giving it the old college try .
0 Episode II -- Attack of the Clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight .
0 The problem with all of this : It 's not really funny .
0 -LRB- Denis ' -RRB- bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product .
0 Wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from Lynch , Jeunet , and von Trier while failing to find a spark of its own .
1 Viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some Freudian puppet .
0 Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste .
0 The mantra behind the project seems to have been ` it 's just a kids ' flick . '
0 Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '
0 In all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant .
0 It takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what TUCK EVERLASTING is about .
1 So here it is : It 's about a family of sour immortals .
0 an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we 've been watching for decades
0 The author 's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling .
0 Writer-director Walter Hill and co-writer David Giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags .
0 There 's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : Mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces .
0 A cockeyed shot all the way .
0 Lush and beautifully photographed -LRB- somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book -RRB- , but ultimately you 'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered .
0 Unfortunately , One Hour Photo lives down to its title .
0 Thanks largely to Williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film .
0 Cold , Sterile And Lacking Any Color Or Warmth .
0 The film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold .
0 Seems like someone going through the motions .
0 For a film about explosions and death and spies , `` Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .
0 Well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies .
1 Wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste .
1 Impostor does n't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast .
1 Wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it is n't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited .
0 Choppy , overlong documentary about ` The Lifestyle . '
0 One sloughs one 's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot .
0 A film which presses familiar Herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised .
1 It 's a fanboy ` what if ? '
2 brought to life on the big screen .
0 The story itself is actually quite vapid .
0 It 's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it does n't offer any insights that have n't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the Dahmer heyday of the mid - '90s .
1 Wait for pay per view or rental but do n't dismiss BarberShop out of hand .
0 A few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and Jordan Brady 's direction is prosaic .
0 Each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top .
0 Would 've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film 's predictable denouement .
1 Then Nadia 's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all .
1 One of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily .
0 Nair just does n't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy .
2 Enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , Walt Becker 's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons .
2 It 's the funniest American comedy since Graffiti Bridge .
0 That neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks .
0 What starts off as a possible Argentine American Beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers .
0 The project 's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger Fatal Attraction into a high school setting .
0 In old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , Ms. Shreve 's novel proved too difficult a text to ` lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .
0 Solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
0 Stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little \*\*\*\* .
0 No cute factor here ... Not that I mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise .
0 Deep down , I realized the harsh reality of my situation : I would leave the theater with a lower I.Q. than when I had entered .
1 A really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film .
0 Aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom.com or the improperly hammy performance from poor Stephen Rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand .
0 It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .
0 For its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .
0 A work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse .
2 A faster paced family flick .
0 Upper Teens may get cynical .
2 Smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy .
0 While this film has an ` A ' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , Vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love .
0 It 's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns .
0 Most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river .
1 It 's all gratuitous before long , as if Schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story .
1 `` I blame all men for war , '' -LRB- the warden 's daughter -RRB- tells her father .
0 The movie is about as deep as that sentiment .
1 It 's fitfully funny but never really takes off .
0 I 've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but Lil Bow Wow takes the cake .
2 By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it ... Then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop .
1 For all the complications , it 's all surprisingly predictable .
1 It 's been 20 years since 48 Hrs .
2 made Eddie Murphy a movie star and the man has n't aged a day .
1 But his showboating wise-cracker stock persona sure is getting old .
1 If Deuces Wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that 's so bad it starts to become good .
0 But it was n't .
0 For a film about action , Ultimate X is the gabbiest giant-screen movie ever , bogging down in a barrage of hype .
0 ... a low rate Annie featuring some kid who ca n't act , only echoes of Jordan , and weirdo actor Crispin Glover screwing things up old school .
0 It might not be 1970s animation , but everything else about it is straight from the Saturday morning cartoons -- a retread story , bad writing , and the same old silliness .
0 The picture seems uncertain whether it wants to be an acidic all-male All About Eve or a lush , swooning melodrama in the Intermezzo strain .
0 A nearly 21\/1 hours , the film is way too indulgent .
0 Gorgeous to look at but insufferably tedious and turgid ... a curiously constricted epic .
1 It looks much more like a cartoon in the end than The Simpsons ever has .
0 With a tighter editorial process and firmer direction this material could work , especially since the actresses in the lead roles are all more than competent , but as is , Personal Velocity seems to be idling in neutral .
0 Does n't really add up to much .
0 It 's better suited for the history or biography channel , but there 's no arguing the tone of the movie - it leaves a bad taste in your mouth and questions on your mind .
0 An entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots .
0 A prolonged extrusion of psychopathic pulp .
0 Borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion .
0 It 's surprisingly bland despite the heavy doses of weird performances and direction .
0 A chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece ... so dull that its tagline should be : ` In space , no one can hear you snore . '
0 The characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
0 Sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor Hermocrates and Leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours .
0 It 's like a drive-by .
0 You can drive right by it without noticing anything special , save for a few comic turns , intended and otherwise .
0 Everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized .
0 This would-be ` James Bond for the Extreme Generation ' pic is one big , dumb action movie .
0 Stress ` dumb . '
1 The movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .
0 When your subject is illusion versus reality , should n't the reality seem at least passably real ?
0 It 's a terrible movie in every regard , and utterly painful to watch .
0 This is rote spookiness , with nary an original idea -LRB- or role , or edit , or score , or anything , really -RRB- in sight , and the whole of the proceedings beg the question ` Why ? '
0 A fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down .
0 Too infuriatingly quirky and taken with its own style .
0 There 's a whole heap of nothing at the core of this slight coming-of-age\/coming-out tale .
2 As much as I laughed throughout the movie , I can not mount a cogent defense of the film as entertainment , or even performance art , although the movie does leave you marveling at these guys ' superhuman capacity to withstand pain .
0 The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .
0 Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .
0 Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .
0 Unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you 're going to feel like you were n't invited to the party .
0 When the casting call for this movie went out , it must have read ` seeking anyone with acting ambition but no sense of pride or shame . '
0 Just is n't as weird as it ought to be .
0 A `` Home Alone '' film that is staged like `` Rosemary 's Baby , '' but is not as well-conceived as either of those films .
0 -LRB- Siegel -RRB- and co-writers Lisa Bazadona and Grace Woodard have relied too much on convention in creating the characters who surround Frankie .
0 No film could possibly be more contemptuous of the single female population .
1 ` Hey Arnold ! '
1 has some visual wit ... but little imagination elsewhere .
1 They 're going through the motions , but the zip is gone .
0 A sluggish pace and lack of genuine narrative hem the movie in every bit as much as life hems in the spirits of these young women .
0 A low-budget affair , Tadpole was shot on digital video , and the images often look smeary and blurry , to the point of distraction .
0 Then again , in a better movie , you might not have noticed .
1 It 's mindless junk like this that makes you appreciate original romantic comedies like Punch-Drunk Love .
0 The movie is like a year late for tapping into our reality tv obsession , and even tardier for exploiting the novelty of the `` webcast . ''
0 tale will be all too familiar for anyone who 's seen George Roy Hill 's 1972 film , `` The Sting . ''
0 Gets the look and the period trappings right , but it otherwise drowns in a sea of visual and verbal clichés .
2 It 's hard to quibble with a flick boasting this many genuine cackles , but Notorious C.H.O. still feels like a promising work-in-progress .
0 Anyone who wants to start writing screenplays can just follow the same blueprint from hundreds of other films , sell it to the highest bidder and walk away without anyone truly knowing your identity .
0 The problem with The Bread , My Sweet is that it 's far too sentimental .
1 A late-night cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques .
1 Falls short in explaining the music and its roots .
0 Never inspires more than an interested detachment .
0 What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .
0 Despite slick production values and director Roger Michell 's tick-tock pacing , the final effect is like having two guys yelling in your face for two hours .
0 Pretty much sucks , but has a funny moment or two .
1 They do a good job of painting this family dynamic for the audience but they tried to squeeze too many elements into the film .
0 A supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama .
0 It ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
0 Two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .
1 It is so earnest , so overwrought and so wildly implausible that it begs to be parodied .
0 These are textbook lives of quiet desperation .
1 Swimfan , like Fatal Attraction , eventually goes overboard with a loony melodramatic denouement in which a high school swimming pool substitutes for a bathtub .
0 Claims to sort the bad guys from the good , which is its essential problem .
0 Purposefully shocking in its eroticized gore , if unintentionally dull in its lack of poetic frissons .
0 Feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together .
1 Almost everything about the film is unsettling , from the preposterous hairpiece worn by Lai 's villainous father to the endless action sequences .
0 Writer-director Randall Wallace has bitten off more than he or anyone else could chew , and his movie veers like a drunken driver through heavy traffic .
0 It follows the Blair Witch formula for an hour , in which we 're told something creepy and vague is in the works , and then it goes awry in the final 30 minutes .
0 One ca n't shake the feeling that Crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for Britney 's latest album .
0 Phoned-in business as usual .
1 There 's an epic here , but you have to put it together yourself .
0 What little atmosphere is generated by the shadowy lighting , macabre sets , and endless rain is offset by the sheer ugliness of everything else .
1 Director-chef Gabriele Muccino keeps it fast -- zippy , comin ' at ya -- as if fearing that his film is molto superficiale .
0 Tartakovsky 's team has some freakish powers of visual charm , but the five writers slip into the modern rut of narrative banality .
0 The most horrific movie experience I 've had since `` Ca n't Stop The Music . ''
0 It may as well be called `` Jar-Jar Binks : The Movie . ''
0 It 's that painful .
1 God is great , the movie 's not .
0 Like a three-ring circus , there are side stories aplenty -- none of them memorable .
1 When in doubt , the film ratchets up the stirring soundtrack , throws in a fish-out-of-water gag and lets the cliched dialogue rip .
1 Or else a doggie winks .
0 A ` Girls Gone Wild ' video for the boho art-house crowd , The Burning Sensation is n't a definitive counter-cultural document -- its makers are n't removed and inquisitive enough for that .
0 As original and insightful as last week 's episode of Behind the Music .
0 Plays like John Le Carré with a couple of burnt-out cylinders .
0 You may be galled that you 've wasted nearly two hours of your own precious life with this silly little puddle of a movie .
2 It 's neither as sappy as Big Daddy nor as anarchic as Happy Gilmore or The Waterboy , but it has its moments .
2 Despite the surface attractions -- Conrad L. Hall 's cinematography will likely be nominated for an Oscar next year -- there 's something impressive and yet lacking about everything .
0 A smug and convoluted action-comedy that does n't allow an earnest moment to pass without reminding audiences that it 's only a movie .
1 -LRB- Crystal and De Niro -RRB- manage to squeeze out some good laughs but not enough to make this silly con job sing .
0 Worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames .
0 The Christ allegory does n't work because there is no foundation for it
1 Go for La Salle 's performance , and make do as best you can with a stuttering script .
0 It 's hard to care about a film that proposes as epic tragedy the plight of a callow rich boy who is forced to choose between his beautiful , self-satisfied 22-year-old girlfriend and an equally beautiful , self-satisfied 18-year-old mistress .
0 Tries too hard to be funny in a way that 's too loud , too goofy and too short of an attention span .
0 I did n't find much fascination in the swinging .
0 What they 're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge .
2 But that they are doing it is thought-provoking .
0 The acting is just fine , but there 's not enough substance here to sustain interest for the full 90 minutes , especially with the weak payoff .
0 After Collateral Damage , you might imagine that most every aggrieved father cliché has been unturned .
0 But no. .
0 Ultimately the , yes , snail-like pacing and lack of thematic resonance make the film more silly than scary , like some sort of Martha Stewart decorating program run amok .
0 Releasing a film with the word ` dog ' in its title in January lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and Snow Dogs deserves every single one of them .
0 Tedious Norwegian offering which somehow snagged an Oscar nomination .
1 It was a dark and stormy night ...
0 A dark-as-pitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality , probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment .
1 This sort of cute and cloying material is far from Zhang 's forte and it shows .
0 Bray is completely at sea ; with nothing but a Savage Garden music video on his resume , he has no clue about making a movie .
1 Freundlich 's made -LRB- Crudup -RRB- a suburban architect , and a cipher .
0 a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre
0 Though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .
1 Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .
0 What starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .
0 Exhibits the shallow sensationalism characteristic of soap opera ... more salacious telenovela than serious drama .
0 Seagal is painfully foolish in trying to hold onto what 's left of his passe ' chopsocky glory .
1 Even with Harris 's strong effort , the script gives him little to effectively probe Lear 's soul-stripping breakdown .
0 The story is bogus and its characters tissue-thin .
1 Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?
0 is an inexpressible and drab wannabe looking for that exact niche .
0 While American Adobo has its heart -LRB- and its palate -RRB- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even .
0 Imagine a film that begins as a Seven rip-off , only to switch to a mix of The Shining , The Thing , and any naked teenagers horror flick from the 1980s .
0 Most of the dialogue made me want to pack raw dough in my ears .
0 Costner 's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as Shadyac 's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink Laurence Olivier .
0 It 's coherent , well shot , and tartly acted , but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate .
2 Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .
0 turns a potentially interesting idea into an excruciating film school experience that plays better only for the film 's publicists or for people who take as many drugs as the film 's characters
1 Robin Williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role .
0 High Crimes is a cinematic misdemeanor , a routine crime thriller remarkable only for its lack of logic and misuse of two fine actors , Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd .
0 Set in a 1986 Harlem that does n't look much like anywhere in New York .
0 The chocolate factory without Charlie .
0 Long on twinkly-eyed close-ups and short on shame .
0 Hip-hop rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture .
0 A dull , somnambulant exercise in pretension whose pervasive quiet is broken by frequent outbursts of violence and noise .
0 Deserving of its critical backlash and more .
1 Neither a rousing success nor a blinding embarrassment .
0 Still , it just sits there like a side dish no one ordered .
0 The Sum of All Fears is remarkably fuddled about motives and context , which drains it of the dramatic substance that would shake us in our boots -LRB- or cinema seats -RRB- .
0 The movie spends more time with Schneider than with newcomer McAdams , even though her performance is more interesting -LRB- and funnier -RRB- than his .
0 This low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the Farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .
0 It recycles every cliché about gays in what is essentially an extended soap opera .
1 I 'm all for the mentally challenged getting their fair shot in the movie business , but surely it does n't have to be as a collection of keening and self-mutilating sideshow geeks .
0 May offend viewers not amused by the sick sense of humor .

0 All of the filmmakers ' calculations ca n't rescue Brown Sugar from the curse of blandness .
1 The movie 's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself does n't stand a ghost of a chance .
0 ... post-September 10 , `` The Sum Of All Fears '' seems more tacky and reprehensible , manipulating our collective fear without bestowing the subject with the intelligence or sincerity it unequivocally deserves .
0 The exclamation point seems to be the only bit of glee you 'll find in this dreary mess .
1 No matter how you slice it , Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton are not Hepburn and Grant , two cinematic icons with chemistry galore .
0 Godard 's ode to tackling life 's wonderment is a rambling and incoherent manifesto about the vagueness of topical excess ... In Praise of Love remains a ponderous and pretentious endeavor that 's unfocused and tediously exasperating .
0 Humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
0 The movie 's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase ` fatal script error . '

1 About Amy 's cuteness , Amy 's career success -LRB- she 's a best-selling writer of self-help books who ca n't help herself -RRB- , and Amy 's neuroses when it comes to men .
0 Everything about Girls Ca n't Swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way .
0 Feels aimless for much of its running time , until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives , leaving questions in its wake .
0 In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .

0 This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .
0 These self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .
0 The fact that the ` best part ' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of Demme 's good films does n't bode well for the rest of it .
0 Richard Pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but Lawrence gives us mostly fool 's gold .
1 The band performances featured in Drumline are red hot ... -LRB- but -RRB- from a mere story point of view , the film 's ice cold .

1 I believe Silberling had the best intentions here , but he just does n't have the restraint to fully realize them .
0 plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure Hollywood .
0 McTiernan 's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .
0 High Crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government \/ Marine\/legal mystery , and that 's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .
0 This movie is about the worst thing Chan has done in the United States .
0 The explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .

0 The crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .
0 I wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .
0 The superior plotline is n't quite enough to drag along the dead -LRB- water -RRB- weight of the other .
0 The film does n't really care about the thousands of Americans who die hideously , it cares about how Ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the CIA .
0 Adrift , Bentley and Hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as Ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .
0 After an hour and a half of wondering -- sometimes amusedly , sometimes impatiently -- just what this strenuously unconventional movie is supposed to be , you discover that the answer is as conventional as can be .
0 ` Linklater fans , or pretentious types who want to appear avant-garde will suck up to this project ... '
0 A woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite Iwai 's vaunted empathy .
1 Screenwriter Chris ver Weil 's directing debut is good-natured and never dull , but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability .
0 If you really want to understand what this story is really all about , you 're far better served by the source material .
0 It 's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist ... studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .
0 Like its title character , Esther Kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .
0 The star who helped give a spark to `` Chasing Amy '' and `` Changing Lanes '' falls flat as thinking man CIA agent Jack Ryan in this summer 's new action film , `` The Sum of All Fears . ''
0 A summary of the plot does n't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .
0 Every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .
0 Snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like ` masterpiece ' and ` triumph ' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers ' time with a gobbler like this .
0 -LRB- The film 's -RRB- taste for `` shock humor '' will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of Tom Green and the Farrelly Brothers .
2 Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .
1 If legendary shlockmeister Ed Wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from Anne Rice 's novel The Vampire Chronicles .
1 Hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman 's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .
0 Interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .
0 Things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .
1 It 's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent Electra rebellion .
1 Bogs down badly as we absorb Jia 's moody , bad-boy behavior which he portrays himself in a one-note performance .
1 The camera whirls !
1 The camera twirls !
2 Oh , look at that clever angle !

0 Demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from Oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .
0 The action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if Kaos had n't blown them all up .
0 It almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .
2 It puts Washington , as honest working man John Q. Archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .
0 Ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you 're up for that sort of thing .
2 Far more enjoyable than its predecessor .
2 -LRB- Gayton 's script -RRB- telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .
0 Full Frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre 's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .
0 A ragbag of cliches .
1 This rough trade Punch-and-Judy act did n't play well then and it plays worse now .
0 The three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling .
0 It 's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling .
0 This painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications ... that have no bearing on the story .

1 You know that ten bucks you 'd spend on a ticket ?
0 Just send it to Cranky .
0 We do n't get paid enough to sit through crap like this .
0 An even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor .
0 The whole thing plays like a tired Tyco ad .
0 The film does n't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal .
1 The soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too .
0 No , I do n't know why Steven Seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money .
0 Even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , Sorority Boys is a bowser .
0 One well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing .
1 Proof of this is Ballistic : Ecks vs. Sever .
0 Halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , Blade II mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary .
0 Weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting .
0 We ca n't accuse Kung Pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie .
0 Unfortunately , we 'd prefer a simple misfire .
0 There is n't one moment in the film that surprises or delights .
1 ` Would n't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it 's like on the other side of the bra ? '
1 The movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors ' moments .
0 Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how Broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence .
0 This movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .
0 The secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before I see this piece of crap again .

0 The lousy lead performances ... keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired .
0 Its and pieces of The Hot Chick are so hilarious , and Schneider 's performance is so fine , it 's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in The Animal -- is a slapdash mess .
0 -LRB- Creates -RRB- the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama .
0 The movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates .
2 Earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding .
0 A sugar-coated Rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks .
0 Romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong .
0 They cheapen the overall effect .
0 Has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of General Hospital .
0 An acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it 's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to McDonald 's , let alone some savvy street activism .
1 -LRB- Allen 's -RRB- been making piffle for a long while , and Hollywood Ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .
0 An exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .
0 Not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .
0 The movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it were n't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .
0 Watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when Carol Kane appears on the screen .
0 The scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film 's characters .
1 Merchant has n't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage .
0 The film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it 's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is .
0 More a gunfest than a Rock concert .
0 It 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni .
0 A muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations .

0 It 's not original enough .
0 A listless sci-fi comedy in which Eddie Murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .
1 Little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its Summer X Games .
0 A generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it is n't merely offensive .
0 Julie Davis is the Kathie Lee Gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego does n't always go hand in hand with talent .
0 An unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled ` hip ' , ` innovative ' and ` realistic ' .
0 The story 's pathetic and the gags are puerile . .
0 Curiously , Super Troopers suffers because it does n't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length .
0 So bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled Generic Jennifer Lopez Romantic Comedy .
1 I was sent a copyof this film to review on DVD .
1 For free .
0 I still want my money back .
0 It plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its `` dead wife communicating from beyond the grave '' framework is even remotely new or interesting .
1 It 's hard to believe that a relationship like Holly and Marina 's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .
0 All too familiar ... basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when ` Angels With Dirty Faces ' appeared in 1938 .
1 ... passable enough for a shoot-out in the o.k. court house of life type of flick .
1 Strictly middle of the road .
0 Although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it 's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s\/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .
0 After the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .
0 No one can doubt the filmmakers ' motives , but The Guys still feels counterproductive .
0 A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .
0 With little visible talent and no energy , Colin Hanks is in bad need of major acting lessons and maybe a little coffee .

1 Well-meaning to a fault , Antwone Fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man 's triumph of will into everyman 's romance comedy .
0 Seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product 's unshapely look , director Fisher Stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in Waking Life water colors .
0 Formula 50 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .
0 Everything that was right about Blade is wrong in its sequel .
1 A few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot has n't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists ' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .
0 The film was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Joel Schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one -LRB- and no one -RRB- .
0 Disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .
0 Coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock .
0 Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .
1 How much you are moved by the emotional tumult of -LRB- François and Michèle 's -RRB- relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .
0 They presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .
0 Collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .
0 The following things are not at all entertaining : The bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching Seinfeld -LRB- who is also one of the film 's producers -RRB- do everything he can to look like a good guy .
0 Attal 's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare I say , outdated , it 's a wonder that he could n't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .
0 Obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .
0 The most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .
0 Michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it 's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .
1 Ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies .
0 Enigma lacks it .
0 Potty-mouthed enough for PG-12 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as South Park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .
1 ... has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon does n't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .
0 A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .
0 Most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .
0 In the end , Tuck Everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .
0 Rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .
0 McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .
0 Plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .
1 New Yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell ...
0 Amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .
0 Yes , Spirited Away is a triumph of imagination , but it 's also a failure of storytelling .
0 A characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .
1 A somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .
0 Whenever you think you 've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end .
1 But , no , we get another scene , and then another .
0 You begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .
1 An empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .
0 The screenplay , co-written by director Imogen Kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .
0 The milieu is wholly unconvincing ... and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .
0 Unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .
0 Each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .
1 Except for Paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for Bartleby 's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .
1 Will no doubt delight Plympton 's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .
0 The laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .

0 But they lack their idol 's energy and passion for detail .
0 Mattei so completely loses himself to the film 's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , Love in the Time of Money .
1 It briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest - -- audience sadism -- is evaded completely .
2 Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .
0 For every articulate player , such as skateboarder Tony Hawk or BMX rider Mat Hoffman , are about a half dozen young Turks angling to see how many times they can work the words `` radical '' or `` suck '' into a sentence .
0 There 's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .
0 An impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .
0 It 's unfortunate that Wallace , who wrote Gibson 's Braveheart as well as the recent Pearl Harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .
2 I liked the movie , but I know I would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further .
0 I 'm left slightly disappointed that it did n't .
0 Dreary tale of middle-class angst
0 For a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .
0 -LRB- Jackson and Bledel -RRB- seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .

2 It never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .
0 Loud , silly , stupid and pointless .
1 Mandel Holland 's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by Phifer and Black are ultimately winning .

0 I 'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on Johnny Knoxville 's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche .
1 While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .
0 I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .
0 The only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow .
1 Whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors .
0 As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .

1 The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .

0 Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .
0 Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .

0 I 'm sorry to say that this should seal the deal - Arnold is not , nor will he be , back .

0 It 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
0 Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice ?

1 Tennessee Williams by way of Oprah 's Book Club .
1 So verbally flatfooted and so emotionally predictable or bland that it plays like the standard made-for-TV movie .

0 To the filmmakers , Ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there 's no indication that he 's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit .
0 This is a movie filled with unlikable , spiteful idiots ; whether or not their friendship is salvaged makes no difference in the least .
0 It 's as if Allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself .
0 Scotland , PA is entirely too straight-faced to transcend its clever concept .
0 A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .
0 Not only does LeBlanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes .
0 There 's little to recommend Snow Dogs , unless one considers cliched dialogue and perverse escapism a source of high hilarity .
1 It 's deep-sixed by a compulsion to catalog every bodily fluids gag in There 's Something About Mary and devise a parallel clone-gag .
0 The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .
0 Sorority Boys , which is as bad at it is cruel , takes every potential laugh and stiletto-stomps the life out of it .
0 Here the love scenes all end in someone screaming .
0 Maybe there 's a metaphor here , but figuring it out would n't make Trouble Every Day any better .
1 This is the first film I 've ever seen that had no obvious directing involved .
1 Fans of so-bad-they 're - good cinema may find some fun in this jumbled mess .
1 Weiss and Speck never make a convincing case for the relevance of these two 20th-century footnotes .
0 Sheridan is painfully bad , a fourth-rate Jim Carrey who does n't understand the difference between dumb fun and just plain dumb .
0 Presents nothing special and , until the final act , nothing overtly disagreeable .
0 The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .
0 Was that movie nothing more than a tepid exercise in trotting out a formula that worked five years ago but has since lost its fizz ?
0 It goes on for too long and bogs down in a surfeit of characters and unnecessary subplots .
2 It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .
0 Make Chan 's action sequences boring .
0 You ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone .
0 ` In this poor remake of such a well loved classic , Parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '
1 It 's the movie equivalent of a sweaty old guy in a rain coat shopping for cheap porn .
0 The film 's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that Tornatore was right to cut .
0 The movie does such an excellent job of critiquing itself at every faltering half-step of its development that criticizing feels more like commiserating .
0 I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .
0 Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .
0 Viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who 's who in this pretentious mess .
1 A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .
0 Get out your pooper-scoopers .
2 While the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .
0 It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .
0 Sheridan seems terrified of the book 's irreverent energy , and scotches most of its élan , humor , bile , and irony .
0 More busy than exciting , more frantic than involving , more chaotic than entertaining .
1 There are more shots of children smiling for the camera than typical documentary footage which hurts the overall impact of the film .
0 It 's makes a better travelogue than movie .
0 It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .
1 The fourth in a series that I 'll bet most parents had thought -- hoped !
1 -- was a fad that had long since vanished .
0 It 's a long way from Orwell 's dark , intelligent warning cry -LRB- 1982 -RRB- to the empty stud knockabout of Equilibrium , and what once was conviction is now affectation .
0 Its premise is smart , but the execution is pretty weary .
0 The holiday message of the 37-minute Santa vs. the Snowman leaves a lot to be desired .
2 more precious than perspicacious
0 If you saw it on TV , you 'd probably turn it off , convinced that you had already seen that movie .
0 -LRB- T -RRB- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .
0 If this is cinema , I pledge allegiance to Cagney and Lacey .
2 Enigma looks great , has solid acting and a neat premise .
0 Yet why it fails is a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma .
1 Most of the characters come off as pantomimesque sterotypes .
0 Starts promisingly but disintegrates into a dreary , humorless soap opera .
2 While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .
1 It 's actually too sincere -- the crime movie equivalent of a chick flick .
1 Most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for Shearer 's radio show and his Simpson voice-overs .
0 Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .
1 Nor is it a romantic comedy .
1 Culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-Harry Potter -- right down to the Gryffindor scarf .
0 Memorable for a peculiar malaise that renders its tension flaccid and , by extension , its surprises limp and its resolutions ritual .
1 It 's a documentary that says that the alternate sexuality meant to set you free may require so much relationship maintenance that celibacy can start looking good .
0 In the not-too-distant future , movies like Ghost Ship will be used as analgesic balm for overstimulated minds .
0 Right now , they 're merely signposts marking the slow , lingering death of imagination .
0 The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .
0 Like most movies about the pitfalls of bad behavior ... Circuit gets drawn into the party .
0 It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .
0 Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .
1 Snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good .
0 Piccoli 's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm 's - length in the film seem irritatingly transparent .
0 Starts out mediocre , spirals downward , and thuds to the bottom of the pool with an utterly incompetent conclusion .
0 Nicolas Cage is n't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray , and this movie wo n't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career .
0 It lacks the compassion , good-natured humor and the level of insight that made -LRB- Eyre 's -RRB- first film something of a sleeper success .
1 The result is good gossip , entertainingly delivered , yet with a distinctly musty odour , its expiry date long gone .
0 A sustained fest of self-congratulation between actor and director that leaves scant place for the viewer .
1 All Analyze That proves is that there is really only one movie 's worth of decent gags to be gleaned from the premise .
0 Green ruins every single scene he 's in , and the film , while it 's not completely wreaked , is seriously compromised by that .
0 There 's not a comedic moment in this romantic comedy .
0 The story is predictable , the jokes are typical Sandler fare , and the romance with Ryder is puzzling .
1 Wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .
0 Resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad Blair Witch Project .
0 Poor Ben Bratt could n't find stardom if MapQuest emailed him point-to-point driving directions .
0 Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .
0 Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .
0 A fake street drama that keeps telling you things instead of showing them .
0 An empty , purposeless exercise .
1 Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .
0 Haneke 's script -LRB- from Elfriede Jelinek 's novel -RRB- is contrived , unmotivated , and psychologically unpersuasive , with an inconclusive ending .
0 A sometimes incisive and sensitive portrait that is undercut by its awkward structure and a final veering toward melodrama .
0 Those 24-and-unders looking for their own Caddyshack to adopt as a generational signpost may have to keep on looking .
0 A distinctly mixed bag , the occasional bursts of sharp writing alternating with lots of sloppiness and the obligatory moments of sentimental ooze .
0 What begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .
1 Ultimately , Jane learns her place as a girl , softens up and loses some of the intensity that made her an interesting character to begin with .
0 Ah-nuld 's action hero days might be over .
0 It 's clear why Deuces Wild , which was shot two years ago , has been gathering dust on MGM 's shelf .
1 Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .
1 When the precise nature of Matthew 's predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .
0 This picture is murder by numbers , and as easy to be bored by as your ABC 's , despite a few whopping shootouts .
1 Hilarious musical comedy though stymied by accents thick as mud .
2 If you are into splatter movies , then you will probably have a reasonably good time with The Salton Sea .
0 A dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets .
0 The feature-length stretch ... strains the show 's concept .
0 This slender plot feels especially thin stretched over the nearly 80-minute running time .
1 A film that will probably please people already fascinated by Behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration .
1 Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .
0 The densest distillation of Roberts ' movies ever made .
0 Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy cliché of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .
0 A handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on PBS than a night out at an AMC .
1 Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .
1 -LRB- It -RRB- highlights not so much the crime lord 's messianic bent , but Spacey 's .
0 Master of Disguise runs for only 70 minutes and feels like three hours .
0 A reworking of Die Hard and Cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either .
0 Suffers from unlikable characters and a self-conscious sense of its own quirky hipness .
0 A film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity .
2 Fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget .
0 But the problem with Wendigo , for all its effective moments , is n't really one of resources .
2 Spirit is a visual treat , and it takes chances that are bold by studio standards , but it lacks a strong narrative .
0 It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .
0 Their contrast is neither dramatic nor comic -- it 's just a weird fizzle .
2 This is a children 's film in the truest sense .
2 It 's packed with adventure and a worthwhile environmental message , so it 's great for the kids .
1 Parents , on the other hand , will be ahead of the plot at all times , and there is n't enough clever innuendo to fil
1 The niftiest trick perpetrated by The Importance of Being Earnest is the alchemical transmogrification of Wilde into Austen -- and a Hollywood-ized Austen at that .
0 Tykwer 's surface flash is n't just a poor fit with Kieslowski 's lyrical pessimism ; it completely contradicts everything Kieslowski 's work aspired to , including the condition of art .
1 Ice Age is the first computer-generated feature cartoon to feel like other movies , and that makes for some glacial pacing early on .
0 Too slick and manufactured to claim street credibility .
0 Cherry Orchard is badly edited , often awkwardly directed and suffers from the addition of a wholly unnecessary pre-credit sequence designed to give some of the characters a ` back story . '
0 What ensues are much blood-splattering , mass drug-induced bowel evacuations , and none-too-funny commentary on the cultural distinctions between Americans and Brits .
0 A dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so .
0 The movie is without intent .
1 Visually exciting sci-fi film which suffers from a lackluster screenplay .
0 While Hollywood Ending has its share of belly laughs -LRB- including a knockout of a closing line -RRB- , the movie winds up feeling like a great missed opportunity .
0 If The Full Monty was a freshman fluke , Lucky Break is -LRB- Cattaneo -RRB- sophomore slump .
0 Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great team , but this predictable romantic comedy should get a pink slip .
0 Allegiance to Chekhov , which director Michael Cacoyannis displays with somber earnestness in the new adaptation of The Cherry Orchard , is a particularly vexing handicap .
0 You expect more from director Michael Apted -LRB- Enigma -RRB- and screenwriter Nicholas Kazan -LRB- Reversal of Fortune -RRB- than this cliche pileup .
0 The first mistake , I suspect , is casting Shatner as a legendary professor and Kunis as a brilliant college student -- where 's Pauly Shore as the rocket scientist ?
0 The dramatic scenes are frequently unintentionally funny , and the action sequences -- clearly the main event -- are surprisingly uninvolving .
0 Replacing John Carpenter 's stylish tracking shots is degraded , handheld Blair Witch video-cam footage .
0 Of all the Halloween 's , this is the most visually unappealing .
0 It has the requisite faux-urban vibe and hotter-two-years-ago rap and R&B names and references .
0 Despite its dry wit and compassion , the film suffers from a philosophical emptiness and maddeningly sedate pacing .
0 ... feels as if -LRB- there 's -RRB- a choke leash around your neck so director Nick Cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something .
0 Attal pushes too hard to make this a comedy or serious drama .
0 He seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither .
0 I could have used my two hours better watching Being John Malkovich again .
1 It 's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from .
0 Girlfriends are bad , wives are worse and babies are the kiss of death in this bitter Italian comedy .
0 The only young people who possibly will enjoy it are infants ... who might be distracted by the movie 's quick movements and sounds .
2 The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .
0 No Such Thing breaks no new ground and treads old turf like a hippopotamus ballerina .
1 Unfortunately , neither Sendak nor the directors are particularly engaging or articulate .
0 A wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters ' decisions only unsatisfactorily .
1 Bang !
2 Zoom !
1 It 's actually pretty funny , but in all the wrong places .
0 Lurid and less than lucid work .
0 A wannabe comedy of manners about a brainy prep-school kid with a Mrs. Robinson complex founders on its own preciousness -- and squanders its beautiful women .
1 At a brief 41 minutes , we need more X and less blab .
2 If anything , see it for Karen Black , who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named Dirty Dick .
0 This 90-minute dud could pass for Mike Tyson 's E !
1 True Hollywood Story .
0 This is surely one of the most frantic , virulent and foul-natured Christmas season pics ever delivered by a Hollywood studio .
0 Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .
1 A porn film without the sex scenes .
0 The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .
0 A depressingly retrograde , ` post-feminist ' romantic comedy that takes an astonishingly condescending attitude toward women .
0 Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version -LRB- no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance -RRB- , but the excitement is missing .
1 By the end , you just do n't care whether that cold-hearted snake Petrovich -LRB- that would be Reno -RRB- gets his comeuppance .
2 Just bring on the Battle Bots , please !
0 While it 's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own .
0 Broder 's screenplay is shallow , offensive and redundant , with pitifully few real laughs .
1 Yes they can swim , the title is merely Anne-Sophie Birot 's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through .
1 Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .
1 Slow , silly and unintentionally hilarious .
0 The Sweetest Thing leaves a bitter taste .
0 In a big corner office in Hell , Satan is throwing up his hands in surrender , is firing his R&D people , and has decided he will just screen The Master of Disguise 24\/7 .
0 For something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -LRB- sci-fi -RRB- rehash .
0 A thriller without a lot of thrills .
0 This stuck pig of a movie flails limply between bizarre comedy and pallid horror .
1 Ah , the travails of metropolitan life !
1 Alas , another breathless movie about same !
1 In Moonlight Mile , no one gets shut out of the hug cycle .
1 Though uniformly well acted , especially by young Ballesta and Galan -LRB- a first-time actor -RRB- , writer\/director Achero Manas 's film is schematic and obvious .
0 Done in mostly by a weak script that ca n't support the epic treatment .
0 Despite its visual virtuosity , ` Naqoyqatsi ' is banal in its message and the choice of material to convey it .
0 Slap her - she 's not funny !
0 No French people were harmed during the making of this movie , but they were insulted and the audience was put through torture for an hour and a half .
2 Though its rather routine script is loaded with familiar situations , the movie has a cinematic fluidity and sense of intelligence that makes it work more than it probably should .
0 `` One look at a girl in tight pants and big tits and you turn stupid ? ''
0 Um ... is n't that the basis for the entire plot ?
1 `` Not really as bad as you might think ! ''
1 Strident and inelegant in its ` message-movie ' posturing .
2 One regards Reign of Fire with awe .
1 What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea .
1 It has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material .
0 Its impressive images of crematorium chimney fires and stacks of dead bodies are undermined by the movie 's presentation , which is way too stagy .
2 Seeing as the film lacks momentum and its position remains mostly undeterminable , the director 's experiment is a successful one .
1 The plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .
0 I suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the DVD .
0 An unfortunate title for a film that has nothing endearing about it .
1 Ninety minutes of Viva Castro !
0 can be as tiresome as 9 seconds of Jesse Helms ' anti- Castro rhetoric , which are included
0 Comes off as a long , laborious whine , the bellyaching of a paranoid and unlikable man .
0 It just goes to show , an intelligent person is n't necessarily an admirable storyteller .
1 In a 102-minute film , Aaliyah gets at most 20 minutes of screen time .
0 ... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''
0 Hopelessly inane , humorless and under-inspired .
0 Kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for -LRB- or worth rooting against , for that matter -RRB- .
0 It reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it .
1 None of this has the suavity or classical familiarity of Bond , but much of it is good for a laugh .
0 The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .
0 A great script brought down by lousy direction .
1 Same guy with both hats .
0 Big mistake .
0 A mediocre exercise in target demographics , unaware that it 's the butt of its own joke .
1 Director Kevin Bray excels in breaking glass and marking off the `` Miami Vice '' checklist of power boats , Latin music and dog tracks .
0 He does n't , however , deliver nearly enough of the show 's trademark style and flash .
1 In gleefully , thumpingly hyperbolic terms , it covers just about every cliche in the compendium about crass , jaded movie types and the phony baloney movie biz .
1 The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy .
0 Perhaps even the SLC high command found writer-director Mitch Davis 's wall of kitsch hard going .
2 According to Wendigo , ` nature ' loves the members of the upper class almost as much as they love themselves .
2 An encouraging effort from McCrudden
0 The romance between the leads is n't as compelling or as believable as it should be .
0 If I could have looked into my future and saw how bad this movie was , I would go back and choose to skip it .
1 Fortunately , you still have that option .
0 Supposedly authentic account of a historical event that 's far too tragic to merit such superficial treatment .
0 Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .
0 To Blandly Go Where We Went 8 Movies Ago ...
0 A slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
0 This u-boat does n't have a captain .
0 With nary a glimmer of self-knowledge , -LRB- Crane -RRB- becomes more specimen than character -- and Auto Focus remains a chilly , clinical lab report .
0 This one aims for the toilet and scores a direct hit .
0 Dull , a road-trip movie that 's surprisingly short of both adventure and song .
0 I walked away not really know who `` they '' were , what `` they '' looked like .
0 Why `` they '' were here and what `` they '' wanted and quite honestly , I did n't care .
0 After several scenes of this tacky nonsense , you 'll be wistful for the testosterone-charged wizardry of Jerry Bruckheimer productions , especially because Half Past Dead is like The Rock on a Wal-Mart budget .
1 A relatively effective little potboiler until its absurd , contrived , overblown , and entirely implausible finale .
0 The Country Bears wastes an exceptionally good idea .
0 But the movie that does n't really deliver for country music fans or for family audiences
1 Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .
0 As for children , they wo n't enjoy the movie at all .
0 ... you can be forgiven for realizing that you 've spent the past 20 minutes looking at your watch and waiting for Frida to just die already .
0 Too bad writer-director Adam Rifkin situates it all in a plot as musty as one of the Golden Eagle 's carpets .
1 It 's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another .
0 The movie is genial but never inspired , and little about it will stay with you .
1 The movie obviously seeks to re-create the excitement of such '50s flicks as Jules Verne 's ' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea ' and the George Pal version of H.G. Wells ' ` The Time Machine . '
0 But its storytelling prowess and special effects are both listless .
0 Despite the opulent lushness of every scene , the characters never seem to match the power of their surroundings .
0 even after 90 minutes of playing opposite each other Bullock and Grant still look ill at ease sharing the same scene .
0 What should have been a painless time-killer becomes instead a grating endurance test .
0 A bland , obnoxious 88-minute infomercial for Universal Studios and its ancillary products . . .
0 little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .
1 The movie strains to stay on the light , comic side of the issue , despite the difficulty of doing so when dealing with the destruction of property and , potentially , of life itself .
0 The Master of Disguise is awful .
0 It 's Pauly Shore awful .
0 Do n't say you were n't warned .
0 Disappointing in comparison to other recent war movies ... or any other John Woo flick for that matter .
1 The entire movie is filled with deja vu moments .
0 ` Opening up ' the play more has partly closed it down .
2 What -LRB- Frei -RRB- gives us ... is a man who uses the damage of war -- far more often than the warfare itself -- to create the kind of art shots that fill gallery shows .
0 An ugly , revolting movie .
0 The film is way too full of itself ; it 's stuffy and pretentious in a give-me-an-Oscar kind of way .
0 The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .
0 Watching `` Ending '' is too often like looking over the outdated clothes and plastic knickknacks at your neighbor 's garage sale .
0 You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .
1 Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .
0 It desperately wants to be a wacky , screwball comedy , but the most screwy thing here is how so many talented people were convinced to waste their time .
0 The skills of a calculus major at M.I.T. are required to balance all the formulaic equations in the long-winded heist comedy Who Is Cletis Tout ?
0 From the choppy editing to the annoying score to ` special effects ' by way of replacing objects in a character 's hands below the camera line , `` Besotted '' is misbegotten
0 My advice is to skip the film and pick up the soundtrack .
1 A film that presents an interesting , even sexy premise then ruins itself with too many contrivances and goofy situations .
0 Filled with low-brow humor , gratuitous violence and a disturbing disregard for life .
1 directed in a flashy , empty sub-music video style by a director so self-possessed he actually adds a period to his first name
1 The 70-year-old Godard has become , to judge from In Praise of Love , the sort of bitter old crank who sits behind his light meter and harangues the supposed injustices of the artistic world-at-large without doing all that much to correct them .
0 An unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously .
0 Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .
1 Harvard Man is a semi-throwback , a reminiscence without nostalgia or sentimentality .
1 Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .
0 Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .
1 While Hoffman 's performance is great , the subject matter goes nowhere .
1 The smash 'em - up , crash 'em - up , shoot 'em - up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense .
0 Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet\/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .
0 Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .
0 Theological matters aside , the movie is so clumsily sentimental and ineptly directed it may leave you speaking in tongues .
0 This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .
0 Novak contemplates a heartland so overwhelmed by its lack of purpose that it seeks excitement in manufactured high drama .
0 Been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called The Professional .
0 The film is all over the place , really .
0 It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .
1 The beautiful , unusual music is this film 's chief draw , but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep .
0 The action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory .
0 Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .
0 When -LRB- Reno -RRB- lets her radical flag fly , taking angry potshots at George W. Bush , Henry Kissinger , Larry King , et al. , Reno devolves into a laugh-free lecture .
0 Such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but Kaufman and Gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
0 Burns ' fifth beer-soaked film feels in almost every possible way -- from the writing and direction to the soggy performances -- tossed off .
0 While this one gets off with a good natured warning , future Lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter
0 Another boorish movie from the I-heard-a-joke - at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting .
0 Too much of the movie feels contrived , as if the filmmakers were worried the story would n't work without all those gimmicks .
0 It 's hard to understand why anyone in his right mind would even think to make the attraction a movie .
0 And it 's harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it .
0 The ethos of the Chelsea Hotel may shape Hawke 's artistic aspirations , but he has n't yet coordinated his own DV poetry with the Beat he hears in his soul .
1 The sight of the name Bruce Willis brings to mind images of a violent battlefield action picture , but the film has a lot more on its mind -- maybe too much .
0 Why sit through a crummy , wannabe-hip crime comedy that refers incessantly to old movies , when you could just rent those movies instead , let alone seek out a respectable new one ?
0 The obnoxious special effects , the obligatory outbursts of flatulence and the incessant , so-five-minutes-ago pop music on the soundtrack overwhelm what is left of the scruffy , dopey old Hanna-Barbera charm .
1 Exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as Kerrigan 's platinum-blonde hair .
0 The movie 's downfall is to substitute plot for personality .
0 It does n't really know or care about the characters , and uses them as markers for a series of preordained events .
0 All mood and no movie .
0 Press the delete key .
2 Simone is not a bad film .
0 It just does n't have anything really interesting to say .
0 Once he starts learning to compromise with reality enough to become comparatively sane and healthy , the film becomes predictably conventional .
1 ... hopefully it 'll be at the dollar theatres by the time Christmas rolls around .
0 Wait to see it then .
0 There 's no disguising this as one of the worst films of the summer .
1 Or for the year , for that matter .
0 Lacks the spirit of the previous two , and makes all those jokes about hos and even more unmentionable subjects seem like mere splashing around in the muck .
0 This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .
0 Death to Smoochy tells a moldy-oldie , not-nearly - as-nasty - as-it - thinks-it-is joke .
0 Over and over again .
0 The threat implied in the title Pokémon 4ever is terrifying -- like locusts in a horde these things will keep coming .
0 The film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements , in terms of love , age , gender , race , and class .
0 To call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it .
1 Entertainment more disposable than Hanna-Barbera 's half-hour cartoons ever were .
0 The film falls short on tension , eloquence , spiritual challenge -- things that have made the original New Testament stories so compelling for 20 centuries .
2 By the end of it all I sort of loved the people onscreen , even though I could not stand them .
1 Perhaps the film should be seen as a conversation starter .
0 It 's not an easy one to review .
0 At best this is a film for the under-7 crowd .
0 But it would be better to wait for the video .
1 And a very rainy day .
0 The whole talking-animal thing is grisly .
2 Never Again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction .
1 Would n't it be funny if a bunch of Allied soldiers went undercover as women in a German factory during World War II ?
1 Um , no. .
0 But here 's a movie about it anyway .
1 Has not so much been written as assembled , Frankenstein-like , out of other , marginally better shoot-em-ups .
0 The punch lines that miss , unfortunately , outnumber the hits by three-to-one .
1 But Death to Smoochy keeps firing until the bitter end .
1 Mushes the college-friends genre -LRB- The Big Chill -RRB- together with the contrivances and overwrought emotion of soap operas .
1 Showtime 's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment .
2 Those who trek to the ` plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves .
0 But ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as Mr. De Niro .
0 A determined , ennui-hobbled slog that really does n't have much to say beyond the news flash that loneliness can make people act weird .
2 Too daft by half ... but supremely good natured .
0 Fails in making this character understandable , in getting under her skin , in exploring motivation ... Well before the end , the film grows as dull as its characters , about whose fate it is hard to care .
0 It 's a shame that the storyline and its underlying themes ... finally seem so impersonal or even shallow .
0 Woody , what happened ?
2 Juliette Binoche 's Sand is vivacious , but it 's hard to sense that powerhouse of 19th-century prose behind her childlike smile .
0 It 's supposed to be post-feminist breezy but ends up as tedious as the chatter of parrots raised on Oprah .
0 You can tell almost immediately that Welcome to Collinwood is n't going to jell .
0 Throughout all the tumult , a question comes to mind : So why is this so boring ?
0 Cattaneo reworks the formula that made The Full Monty a smashing success ... but neglects to add the magic that made it all work .
1 Routine and rather silly .
0 A rip-off twice removed , modeled after -LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- earlier copycat Under Siege , sometimes referred to as Die Hard on a boat .
0 Totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are The Greatest Musicians of All Time .
0 You can practically hear George Orwell turning over .
0 Behan 's memoir is great material for a film -- rowdy , brawny and lyrical in the best Irish sense -- but Sheridan has settled for a lugubrious romance .
1 While Holm is terrific as both men and Hjejle quite appealing , the film fails to make the most out of the intriguing premise .
0 Lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it 's compelling .
0 If it were any more of a turkey , it would gobble in Dolby Digital stereo .
0 If nothing else , `` Rollerball '' 2001 may go down in cinema history as the only movie ever in which the rest of the cast was outshined by LL Cool J.
1 A movie that falls victim to frazzled wackiness and frayed satire .
0 How do you make a movie with depth about a man who lacked any ?
0 On the evidence before us , the answer is clear : Not easily and , in the end , not well enough .
0 The film 's trailer also looked like crap , so crap is what I was expecting .
0 More trifle than triumph .
0 The movie is almost completely lacking in suspense , surprise and consistent emotional conviction .
0 Festers in just such a dungpile that you 'd swear you were watching monkeys flinging their feces at you .
0 Lyne 's latest , the erotic thriller Unfaithful , further demonstrates just how far his storytelling skills have eroded .
0 It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .
0 Rumor , a muddled drama about coming to terms with death , feels impersonal , almost generic .
0 Report card : Does n't live up to the exalted tagline - there 's definite room for improvement .
0 Does n't deserve a passing grade -LRB- even on a curve -RRB- .
0 The pacing is deadly , the narration helps little and Naipaul , a juicy writer , is negated .
1 As his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in Long Time Dead says ` I 'm telling you , this is f \*\*\* ed ' .
2 Maybe he was reading the minds of the audience .
0 ... if it had been only half-an-hour long or a TV special , the humor would have been fast and furious -- at ninety minutes , it drags .
0 Bean drops the ball too many times ... hoping the nifty premise will create enough interest to make up for an unfocused screenplay .
1 A well-acted , but one-note film .
0 Blood Work is laughable in the solemnity with which it tries to pump life into overworked elements from Eastwood 's Dirty Harry period .
0 The movie is too amateurishly square to make the most of its own ironic implications .
0 -LRB- Lee -RRB- treats his audience the same way that Jim Brown treats his women -- as dumb , credulous , unassuming , subordinate subjects .
2 And Lee seems just as expectant of an adoring , wide-smiling reception .
0 There 's not one decent performance from the cast and not one clever line of dialogue .
0 No amount of burning , blasting , stabbing , and shooting can hide a weak script .
0 It 's an odd show , pregnant with moods , stillborn except as a harsh conceptual exercise .
0 Nearly all the fundamentals you take for granted in most films are mishandled here .
1 The Armenian genocide deserves a more engaged and honest treatment .
0 Earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner .
0 Ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of Louis Begley 's source novel -LRB- About Schmidt -RRB- and an old Payne screenplay .
2 The exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors .
0 We started to wonder if ... some unpaid intern had just typed ` Chris Rock , ' ` Anthony Hopkins ' and ` terrorists ' into some Univac-like script machine .
0 Even when Crush departs from the 4W formula ... it feels like a glossy rehash .
0 More likely to have you scratching your head than hiding under your seat .
0 Bears is even worse than I imagined a movie ever could be .
0 When you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
0 This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .
0 Marinated in clichés and mawkish dialogue .
0 Whether it 's the worst movie of 2001 , I ca n't say for sure : Memories of Rollerball have faded , and I skipped Country Bears .
0 But this new jangle of noise , mayhem and stupidity must be a serious contender for the title .
0 -LRB- A -RRB- boldly stroked , luridly coloured , uni-dimensional nonsense machine that strokes the eyeballs while it evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain .
0 Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '
0 Rollerball IS as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine .
0 The first question to ask about Bad Company is why Anthony Hopkins is in it .
0 We assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low .
0 Not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general .
0 It merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them .
0 Shame on writer\/director Vicente Aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull .
1 Suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling .
0 Violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
0 Nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .
0 With a completely predictable plot , you 'll swear that you 've seen it all before , even if you 've never come within a mile of The Longest Yard .
0 Remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ?
1 When the twist endings were actually surprising ?
1 When the violence actually shocked ?
1 When the heroes were actually under 40 ?
0 Sadly , as Blood Work proves , that was a long , long time ago .
0 Blue Crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky `` Pretty Woman '' retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought .
0 This movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in Retard 100 .
0 What we get in FearDotCom is more like something from a bad Clive Barker movie .
0 In other words , it 's badder than bad .
0 If they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands I kept looking for the last exit from Brooklyn .
0 A sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like The Ghost and Mr. Chicken .
0 A small independent film suffering from a severe case of Hollywood-itis .
0 Where the film falters is in its tone .
0 The story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head .
0 Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .
1 It 's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up .
0 Feels more like a rejected X-Files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening .
1 Some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills .
0 Men in Black II achieves ultimate insignificance -- it 's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as Whiffle-Ball epic .
1 An enigmatic film that 's too clever for its own good , it 's a conundrum not worth solving .
0 A zombie movie in every sense of the word -- mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious .
1 A film that clearly means to preach exclusively to the converted .
0 It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a Mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that .
2 Definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the Roman Colosseum .
0 Certainly not a good movie , but it was n't horrible either .
0 Although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful .
0 The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .
0 It appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up .
0 Nothing but an episode of Smackdown !
1 in period costume and with a bigger budget .
2 It takes you somewhere you 're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface -LRB- and exotic dancing -RRB- it 's surprisingly old-fashioned .
0 While the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible Anne Rice novel it 's based upon , Queen Of The Damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle .
0 It should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring .
1 A good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance .
0 A tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid .
0 If Hill is n't quite his generation 's Don Siegel -LRB- or Robert Aldrich -RRB- , it 's because there 's no discernible feeling beneath the chest hair ; it 's all bluster and cliché .
0 Stealing Harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : A few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious .
0 This is an insultingly inept and artificial examination of grief and its impacts upon the relationships of the survivors .
1 Does anyone much think the central story of Brendan Behan is that he was a bisexual sweetheart before he took to drink ?
0 ` Martin Lawrence Live ' is so self-pitying , I almost expected there to be a collection taken for the comedian at the end of the show .
0 The dialogue is cumbersome , the simpering soundtrack and editing more so .
0 Never decides whether it wants to be a black comedy , drama , melodrama or some combination of the three .
0 It has become apparent that the franchise 's best years are long past .
1 Does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer boring .
1 Do n't hate El Crimen del Padre Amaro because it 's anti-Catholic .
0 Hate it because it 's lousy .
0 ... better described as a ghost story gone badly awry .
0 Like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they 're struggling to create .
0 The filmmakers are playing to the Big Boys in New York and L.A. To that end , they mock the kind of folks they do n't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers do n't care to understand , either .
2 Competently directed but terminally cute drama .
0 The big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing .
0 Not just unlikable .
0 Disturbing .
0 Disgusting .
0 Without any redeeming value whatsoever .
0 This thing is virtually unwatchable .
2 Those eternally devoted to the insanity of Black will have an intermittently good time .
0 Feel free to go get popcorn whenever he 's not onscreen .
0 The self-serious Equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , is n't much fun without the highs and lows .
2 The work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who ca n't get out of his own way .
0 The main characters are simply named The Husband , The Wife and The Kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort .
0 In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused .
0 Swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then .
0 The only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies .
0 The characters ... are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script .
1 A Sha-Na-Na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .
0 The trouble is , its filmmakers run out of clever ideas and visual gags about halfway through .
1 Spy-vs .
0 - spy action flick with Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu never comes together .
0 A so-so , made-for-TV something posing as a real movie .
1 The only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its Labor Day weekend upload , FearDotCom should log a minimal number of hits .
0 Whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it 's an unhappy situation all around .
0 An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .
2 A formula family tearjerker told with a heavy Irish brogue ... accentuating , rather than muting , the plot 's saccharine thrust .
0 This is Sandler running on empty , repeating what he 's already done way too often .
0 This is as lax and limp a comedy as I 've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material .
0 Time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool `` Clockstoppers , '' but that does n't mean it still wo n't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life .
0 The sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset .
1 Aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production does n't work for me .
1 A preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in Brooklyn circa 1958 .
0 Has none of the crackle of `` Fatal Attraction '' , `` 9 1\/1 Weeks '' , or even `` Indecent Proposal '' , and feels more like Lyne 's stolid remake of `` Lolita '' .
1 Everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the Tinseltown assembly line .
1 An extraordinarily silly thriller .
0 A rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade .
0 Gaping plot holes sink this ` sub ' - standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth .
0 Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .
0 The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .
2 The stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny .
0 The movie is n't painfully bad , something to be ` fully experienced ' ; it 's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten .
0 Charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past Love Story derisions .
0 What a great shame that such a talented director as Chen Kaige has chosen to make his English-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted .
0 No amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story .
2 The film ... presents classic moral-condundrum drama : What would you have done to survive ?
0 The problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of Auschwitz II-Birkenau .
0 ... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .
0 A film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time , and this is n't .
0 Little more than a stylish exercise in revisionism whose point ... is no doubt true , but serves as a rather thin moral to such a knowing fable .
0 The nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations .
0 This is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy .
1 This off-putting French romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of Amélie .
0 overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
1 Ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy .
1 If there ai n't none , you have a problem .
0 The Master of Disguise falls under the category of ` should have been a sketch on Saturday Night Live . '
1 Yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a ca n't - miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong .
0 Koepp 's screenplay is n't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .
0 Is it really an advantage to invest such subtlety and warmth in an animatronic bear when the humans are acting like puppets ?
0 More successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
0 Clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades .
0 It 's hard to pity the ` plain ' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss .
0 Rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash .
0 A banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy .
0 The drama discloses almost nothing .
0 A minor-league soccer remake of The Longest Yard .
0 Belongs in the too-hot-for-TV direct-to-video\/DVD category , and this is why I have given it a one-star rating .
0 As earnest as a community-college advertisement , American Chai is enough to make you put away the guitar , sell the amp , and apply to medical school .
0 A dim-witted and lazy spin-off of the Animal Planet documentary series , Crocodile Hunter is entertainment opportunism at its most glaring .
1 There is more than one joke about putting the toilet seat down .
1 And that should tell you everything you need to know about All the Queen 's Men .
0 Even fans of Ismail Merchant 's work , I suspect , would have a hard time sitting through this one .
1 It 's really just another silly Hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows .
1 It 's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one .
2 The world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like Martin Scorsese .
1 But it does n't need Gangs of New York .
1 Enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts ... What is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with Cage 's best acting .
1 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate .
1 It 's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you 'll likely think of this one .
0 Sade achieves the near-impossible : It turns the Marquis de Sade into a dullard .
0 -LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .
0 One of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies I 've ever seen .
0 Though there 's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film 's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish .
0 Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .
0 Unless there are zoning ordinances to protect your community from the dullest science fiction , Impostor is opening today at a theater near you .
0 It should be doing a lot of things , but does n't .
0 Chen films the resolutely downbeat Smokers Only with every indulgent , indie trick in the book .
0 ... a rather bland affair .
1 Far-fetched premise , convoluted plot , and thematic mumbo jumbo about destiny and redemptive love .
1 The movie tries to be ethereal , but ends up seeming goofy .
1 I was hoping that it would be sleazy and fun , but it was neither .
1 Harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden .
0 Soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , XXX achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence .
0 A boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even Kingsley , are made to look bad .
0 All the Queen 's Men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers .
0 The filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart .
0 Rather than real figures , Elling and Kjell Bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf 's encounter with the world .
2 Mariah Carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in Glitter here in Wisegirls .
0 It 's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it 's all about the silences and if you 're into that , have at it .
0 I suspect that you 'll be as bored watching Morvern Callar as the characters are in it .
0 If you go , pack your knitting needles .
0 The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma .
0 We do n't even like their characters .
0 Some writer dude , I think his name was , uh , Michael Zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that I ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck .
0 The movie does n't generate a lot of energy .
0 It is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously .
0 This feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
0 Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning .
0 It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .
0 A period story about a Catholic boy who tries to help a Jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell .
0 The premise itself is just SOOOOO tired .
0 Pair that with really poor comedic writing ... and you 've got a huge mess .
0 Proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness .
0 Did we really need a remake of `` Charade ? ''
1 Some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff .
0 Stealing Harvard ca n't even do that much .
0 Each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .
0 The only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game .
0 You try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored .
0 I spied with my little eye ... a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
0 Entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching Disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel .
0 The satire is just too easy to be genuinely satisfying .
0 Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .
1 an `` O Bruin , Where Art Thou ? ''
2 - style cross-country adventure ... it has sporadic bursts of liveliness , some so-so slapstick and a few ear-pleasing songs on its soundtrack .
0 A feeble Tootsie knockoff .
0 An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers .
0 ... the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid .
0 The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .
0 An allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals African American professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message .
1 A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .
0 One key problem with these ardently Christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out .
1 Essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
0 A relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty World War II action flick .
0 -LRB- Hell is -RRB- looking down at your watch and realizing Serving Sara is n't even halfway through .
0 Too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community .
0 Leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances .
1 ... a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable .
0 Swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress Andie MacDowell .
0 The histrionic muse still eludes Madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch .
0 You have no affinity for most of the characters .
0 Nothing about them is attractive .
0 What they see in each other also is difficult to fathom .
2 Diaz , Applegate , Blair and Posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused .
1 A technically well-made suspenser ... but its abrupt drop in IQ points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide .
0 An inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .
0 It 's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition .
1 Absolutely -LRB- and unintentionally -RRB- terrifying .
1 Eckstraordinarily lame and Severely boring .
0 Eight Legged Freaks falls flat as a spoof .
0 No matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a Michael Jackson sort of way .
0 You 'll just have your head in your hands wondering why Lee 's character did n't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery .
0 ` Dragonfly ' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue .
1 In his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , Silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls .
1 Blade II has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation .
1 Veers uncomfortably close to pro-Serb propaganda .
0 Movies like High Crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation .
0 How about surprising us by trying something new ?
0 Final verdict : You 've seen it all before .
0 Throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , Windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old World War II movie for overly familiar material .
1 If A Few Good Men told us that we `` ca n't handle the truth '' than High Crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we `` do n't care about the truth . ''
0 Further sad evidence that Tom Tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning Run Lola Run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .
0 You 'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the Zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy .
1 The movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course .
1 This will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things .
0 A full-frontal attack on audience patience .
1 Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .
0 It 's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled .
0 Debut effort by `` Project Greenlight '' winner is sappy and amateurish .
1 One gets the impression the creators of Do n't Ask Do n't Tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes .
0 Too bad none of it is funny .
1 The cast has a high time , but de Broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp .
0 The film , like Jimmy 's routines , could use a few good laughs .
1 The film has too many spots where it 's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that 's especially fit for the kiddies .
0 Purports to be a Hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging .
2 Oh , and more entertaining , too .
0 ... in the pile of useless actioners from MTV schmucks who do n't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .
1 Though it was made with careful attention to detail and is well-acted by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal , I felt disrespected .
0 Humor in I Spy is so anemic .
0 The film is strictly routine .
1 Skillful as he is , Mr. Shyamalan is undone by his pretensions .
1 While the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched Stephen Norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning David S. Goyer is much sillier .
0 In addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , Ballistic : Ecks Vs. Sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase .
1 It shares the first two films ' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between .
1 The Santa Clause 1 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .
0 You can not guess why the cast and crew did n't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed .
0 Barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .
1 If you 're really renting this you 're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you 're interested in Anne Geddes , John Grisham , and Thomas Kincaid .
0 We get the comedy we settle for .
0 The uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them .
1 Two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .
0 A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward : Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs .
0 And neither do cliches , no matter how ` inside ' they are .
2 The campy results make Mel Brooks ' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated .
0 Its appeal will probably limited to LDS Church members and undemanding armchair tourists .
0 The Hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork .
0 Cherish would 've worked a lot better had it been a short film .
0 Manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney ... take your pick .
0 All three descriptions suit Evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new .
1 Hey Arnold !
1 is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .
2 Still , the updated Dickensian sensibility of writer Craig Bartlett 's story is appealing .
0 True to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at .
0 Does n't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the Sundance Film Festival two years ago .
0 The plot is paper-thin and the characters are n't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours .
0 Kaufman 's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious .
1 The film did n't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due .
0 Queen of the Damned is too long with too little going on .
0 It collapses when Mr. Taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller 's rush .
0 Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .
0 ... Blade II is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves .
0 The Rules of Attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing .
0 Though there are many tense scenes in Trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful .
1 In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian .
0 Feels strangely hollow at its emotional core .
1 You have once again entered the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal .
0 The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .
0 This director 's cut -- which adds 50 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera .
0 Characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle .
1 the Venezuelans say things like `` si , pretty much '' and `` por favor , go home '' when talking to Americans .
0 That 's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of `` Dragonfly . ''
0 It 's a movie that ends with Truckzilla , for cryin ' out loud .
0 If that does n't clue you in that something 's horribly wrong , nothing will .
0 Director Tom Shadyac and star Kevin Costner glumly mishandle the story 's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .
0 It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2001 .
0 Like the Tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
0 As pedestrian as they come .
0 A film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen .
0 It 's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer 's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary .
1 Put it somewhere between Sling Blade and South of Heaven , West of Hell in the pantheon of Billy Bob 's body of work .
0 More intellectually scary than dramatically involving .
0 An inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle .
0 The abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture ca n't quite conceal that there 's nothing resembling a spine here .
0 As saccharine as it is disposable .
0 You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .
0 The metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .
0 Very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .
0 Too much power , not enough puff .
0 The attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
0 It 's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by Taylor 's cartoonish performance and the film 's ill-considered notion that Hitler 's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances .
0 A cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic Ladies and Gentlemen , The Fabulous Stains ... Crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential .
1 Muddled , trashy and incompetent
0 For this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull Sorvino has no light touch , and Rodan is out of his league .
0 Narc is all menace and atmosphere .
1 Though excessively tiresome , The Uncertainty Principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore .
0 Despite Juliet Stevenon 's attempt to bring cohesion to Pamela 's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs .
0 It 's tough to be startled when you 're almost dozing .
0 his -LRB- Nelson 's -RRB- screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it .
0 It 's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead .
0 A terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .
0 There are many definitions of ` time waster ' but this movie must surely be one of them .
0 As it stands , Crocodile Hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 Godzilla , which combined scenes of a Japanese monster flick with canned shots of Raymond Burr commenting on the monster 's path of destruction .
1 The thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie .
0 Enigma is well-made , but it 's just too dry and too placid .
2 `` Sweet Home Alabama '' is what it is -- a nice , harmless date film ...
2 One of the best , most understated performances of -LRB- Jack Nicholson 's -RRB- career .
2 The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys ' take on adolescence feels painfully true .
2 It 's a masterpiece .
1 It may not be `` Last Tango in Paris '' but ...
0 They crush each other under cars , throw each other out windows , electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness .
2 And we do n't avert our eyes for a moment .
1 Charming and funny -LRB- but ultimately silly -RRB- movie .
2 Third time 's the charm ... yeah , baby !
1 A pleasant , if forgettable , romp of a film .
2 By the end of the movie , you 're definitely convinced that these women are spectacular .
2 Birot creates a drama with such a well-defined sense of place and age -- as in , 15 years old -- that the torments and angst become almost as operatic to us as they are to her characters .
2 ` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
2 The film delivers what it promises : A look at the `` wild ride '' that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .
2 As a film director , LaBute continues to improve .
2 Will warm your heart without making you feel guilty about it .
2 Catch it ... if you can !
1 Worse than ` Silence of the Lambs ' better than ` Hannibal '
0 American and European cinema has amassed a vast Holocaust literature , but it is impossible to think of any film more challenging or depressing than The Grey Zone .
2 ` Possession , ' based on the book by A.S. Byatt , demands that LaBute deal with the subject of love head-on ; trading in his cynicism for reverence and a little wit
2 It 's the kind of movie that , aside from Robert Altman , Spike Lee , the Coen Brothers and a few others , our moviemakers do n't make often enough .
2 Alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and is n't afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience .
2 The script is smart , not cloying .
2 Visually , ` Santa Clause 1 ' is wondrously creative .
2 A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .
2 One fantastic -LRB- and educational -RRB- documentary .
2 An ambitious ` what if ? '
2 that works .
2 `` The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys '' has flaws , but it also has humor and heart and very talented young actors
2 Nice piece of work .
2 ` Stock up on silver bullets for director Neil Marshall 's intense freight train of a film . '
2 It 's funny , as the old saying goes , because it 's true .
2 Though the film is static , its writer-director 's heart is in the right place , his plea for democracy and civic action laudable .
1 The filmmaker 's heart is in the right place ...
2 From blushing to gushing -- Imamura squirts the screen in ` Warm Water Under a Red Bridge '
2 Apart from anything else , this is one of the best-sustained ideas I have ever seen on the screen .
2 Not a schlocky creature feature but something far more stylish and cerebral -- and , hence , more chillingly effective .
0 Stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish .
1 Yep , it 's `` Waking up in Reno . ''
0 Go back to sleep .
0 I did n't laugh .
0 I did n't smile .
1 I survived .
0 The worst film of the year .
0 In the book-on-tape market , the film of `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' would be an abridged edition
0 A sour attempt at making a Farrelly Brothers-style , down-and-dirty laugher for the female set .
0 Eisenstein lacks considerable brio for a film about one of cinema 's directorial giants .
0 Taken as a whole , The Tuxedo does n't add up to a whole lot .
0 This is no `` Waterboy ! ''
0 Something has been lost in the translation ... another routine Hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise .
0 The result is an ` action film ' mired in stasis .
0 ... a movie that , quite simply , should n't have been made .
2 By turns pretentious , fascinating , ludicrous , provocative and vainglorious .
0 I ca n't recommend it .
2 But it 's surprisingly harmless .
2 What 's next ?
1 The Porky 's Revenge : Ultimate Edition ?
0 The script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish .
1 There 's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .
1 Is `` Ballistic '' worth the price of admission ?
0 Absolutely not .
0 It sucked .
1 Would I see it again ?
1 Please see previous answer .
1 It 's exactly what you 'd expect .
1 `` The Kid Stays in the Picture '' is a great story , terrifically told by the man who wrote it but this Cliff Notes edition is a cheat .
0 A prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell .
1 The movie is obviously a labour of love so Howard appears to have had free rein to be as pretentious as he wanted .
0 This is n't a movie ; it 's a symptom .
0 What we have is a character faced with the possibility that her life is meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance , in a movie that is definitely meaningless , vapid and devoid of substance .
0 If only it were , well , funnier .
0 The script ?
1 Please .
0 Does n't add up to much .
0 One of the worst movies of the year .
0 A complete waste of time .
0 Long before it 's over , you 'll be thinking of 50 ways to leave this loser .
0 One of the worst movies of the year .
0 ... Watching it was painful .
0 The cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .
